220329,acmedsci_220329_3_000,https://acmedsci.ac.uk/policy/overview/how-policy,acmedsci,"The Academy pursues an interdisciplinary approach to policy. We bring together the biological, physical, engineering and social sciences to explore opportunities for innovation and find ways around barriers to progress. We publish working group reports, statements, consultation responses and discussion papers. We connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, private briefings and networking events. We believe public engagement is essential for robust policy making, ensuring recommendations are appropriate and relevant to people's hopes and concerns. We have developed high quality public dialogue models to bring the views of the public and patients to the core of our science policy work. Our policy work has established us as a unique resource for independent, expert advice on medical science policy and career development. Our policy work has impact because of our rigour, independence, engagement, partnership and conduct. Find out more about each of these in the tabs below. Rigour Independence Engagement Partnership Conduct Our Fellows underpin all stages of our policy work. They contribute by suggesting topics, providing evidence, or being members of steering groups or working parties. The Fellows on our Council, including the Officers of the Academy, provide robust governance of the process to ensure that our outputs are thorough and considered. Our major policy reports are peer reviewed by a committee, chaired by a Fellow, before they are submitted for approval by Council. All of this ensures the intellectual rigour and authority of our work. An authoritative evidence base is vital to our policy projects. The expertise and experience of the Fellows is complemented by the participation of other experts. We normally issue a public call for evidence at the start of our major policy studies, which may be followed by a workshop and oral evidence sessions. The independence of our policy work is vital for its credibility and authority. Although many of our major policy projects are commissioned by government and other organisations, we only accept commissions where we can influence the terms of reference and control the time and content of the publication. We try to balance competing interests on working groups, symposium programmes and other groupings that contribute to our work. All our working group members must declare any conflicts of interest that they have. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to inform all stages of our work and connect our Fellows and other experts with policymakers through workshops, roundtables, briefings and networking events. We collaborate with like-minded organisations to agree common positions and to share information. Membership of formal advisory committees as well as informal networks and partnerships enables us to influence policy at its earliest stages, to ensure that our policy recommendations are made with an understanding of the perspective of stakeholders, and to disseminate our reports. Our Fellows and staff work with a diverse range of formal and ad hoc groups that advise government, including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research, events at the annual Party Conferences, briefing papers and private meetings. We are also training a new generation of researchers who are confident in engaging in policy through our highly successful policy internship scheme for PhD students who are funded by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome. We welcome ideas from others about possible new policy projects that we could take on. Our President meets regularly with key politicians, with policymakers such as the Chief Medical Officer and the Government’s Chief Scientific Advisor and with leaders of the life sciences community. We are increasingly engaging with patients and the public in our major policy activities to ensure that the hopes and concerns of wider society, as well as the knowledge of the medical community, shape our advice. Many of our projects are undertaken in collaboration with other UK and international bodies such as charities, research funders, or industry.This increases their impact. We regularly work in partnership – formally and informally – with organisations including: the other UK National Academies; Wellcome; Cancer Research UK; the Medical Research Council; Association of Medical Research Charities and the Medical Schools Council. Our membership of the InterAcademy Medical Panel and the Federation of European Academies of Medicine enables us to influence a European and wider international agenda. The conduct of our projects reflects our commitment to rigour, engagement, partnership and independence. Choosing projects The ideas for new projects may arise from recommendations from the Academy’s Council or Fellowship, or in response to consultations from Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies, or from a direct commission. We work with our Fellows and other experts to develop the scope of the project. We only take on projects where we are sure our work will have an impact. Methodology The nature of the issue we are tackling determines the approach that we use. When we want to make policy recommendations, and where there is likely to be a general consensus between experts, then we will normally undertake a working group study. When there are likely to be a range of views expressed, perhaps because the topic is controversial, or in an emerging research field, then we will organise a workshop or symposium. In some cases quiet diplomacy may be the most influential action. A major working group study allows time for extensive consultation and deliberation, but it can take a long while to generate outputs. Sometimes we need to act very quickly. If needed, we can identify Fellows to respond to an urgent request for advice within hours. Dissemination and follow-up We always plan how we will disseminate the outputs of a project, and follow up the work, before the project is finished. The dissemination plan for major policy reports will include meetings between the experts involved and those at whom our recommendations are targeted. We also disseminate our work through our extensive network of contacts, gained through our membership of formal and informal advisory committees. We use traditional and new media to promote our policy positions. We also have a commitment in our strategy to follow up the key recommendations and conclusions of our reports within two years of publication.",How we work

220329,adaptationfundorg_220329_3_000,https://www.adaptation-fund.org/about/,adaptationfundorg,"About the Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund finances projects and programmes that help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Initiatives are based on country needs, views and priorities. Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$ 850 million to projects and programmes to date, including 123 concrete projects. This spans nearly 100 countries, including 19 small island developing states and 33 least developed countries, serving about 28 million total beneficiaries. It also pioneered Direct Access, empowering countries to access funding and develop projects directly through accredited national implementing entities. Climate change is predicted to greatly affect the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives. The Fund is financed largely by government and private donors, and also from a two percent share of proceeds of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issued under the Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism projects.

220329,biocarbonfund_220329_3_000,https://www.biocarbonfund-isfl.org/who-we-are,biocarbonfund,"Home Who We Are Who We Are ISFL at a Glance The BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL) is a multilateral fund, supported by donor governments and managed by the World Bank. It promotes reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the land sector, including efforts to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+), sustainable agriculture, as well as smarter land-use planning, policies and practices. The ISFL currently supports programs in Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Zambia. These large-scale programs are pioneering work that enables countries and the private sector to adopt changes in the way farmers work on the ground, as well as informing policies made at the international level. Global Context Forests are not only the lungs of the planet, but they are also at the heart of many of the world’s most pressing challenges. Forests produce food for a growing population; they regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce the impact of extreme climate events such as storms and heat waves. Their role in protecting critical infrastructure and providing a source of energy often goes unnoticed. Not only are forests the guardians of biodiverse ecosystems, they are also home to some of the world’s most vulnerable populations. Despite their importance to life on earth, forests are threatened by pressures to convert land for agricultural production, energy expansion, mining, infrastructure development, and urban expansion. Deforestation, forest degradation, and land-use change alone are responsible for nearly a quarter of the world’s GHG emissions. New tools and approaches to address deforestation, climate change, and sustainable development offer hope. The global community is increasingly aware of forests’ importance to the global economy and the risks that forest loss poses to economic productivity, supply chains, and global well-being. Building on momentum at the international, national, and subnational levels, climate-smart land-use approaches—applied across agriculture, forestry, and other land-use sectors—offer innovative and effective solutions to address the multifaceted challenges of deforestation and land-use change. Today, there is a huge network of governments, businesses, civil society, and local communities working to advance the land-use carbon agenda internationally. Building on the BioCarbon Fund’s 15+ years of experience, the ISFL is creating a portfolio of programs that will promote sustainable agriculture, forestry and smarter land-use practices in an integrated approach. ISFL programs cover a variety of geographies and will transform large rural areas by protecting natural forests, restoring degraded lands, and enhancing agricultural productivity, thereby improving livelihoods and local environments. Now more than ever, it is imperative that countries and the private sector redouble their efforts and forge new partnerships to achieve a much more sustainable future for life on our planet. The ISFL aims to play a key role in that pursuit. Partners and Stakeholders Partnerships with public and private sector actors are essential to mobilize capital and align objectives to create sustainable and scalable models for long-term improved land use. The ISFL partners with a wide range of partners and stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land use across an entire jurisdiction while simultaneously creating livelihood opportunities.

BioCFplus supports grant-based technical assistance activities and capacity-building efforts in each jurisdiction. It provides the critical investment finance needed to establish an enabling environment for sustainable land use and develop systems for monitoring, reporting, and verifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. In addition, BioCFplus directly finances advisory service projects aimed at attracting private sector interest in ISFL jurisdictions, which can benefit farmers and other private sector actors. BioCF Tranche 3 (T3) provides results-based payments for verified reductions in GHG emissions through an Emission Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA). The BioCFplus in combination with results-based finance from BioCF T3 allows ISFL programs to use tools and approaches tailored to a country’s specific context. The BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL) collaborates with countries around the world to reduce emissions from the land sector through smarter land-use planning, policies, and practices.",Who We Are

Ground-breaking research about this topic is booming and has led to a better understanding of how over a trillion microorganisms, which live in our gut (bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi), interact to keep the digestive system functioning properly and to form a complex ecosystem that plays a fundamental role in human health and diseases. However, there still remains a lot to be explored. The Biocodex Microbiota Foundation for sciences advance and better care of human microbiota As a world-renowned leader in microbiota research and a pioneer in probiotic treatments, Biocodex launched in 2017 a Foundation dedicated to enhancing scientific knowledge about the human microbiota, improving our understanding of microbiota, disseminating this knowledge as widely as possible and eventually, contributing to improve human health. Each year, the Biocodex Microbiota Foundation awards annual grants to innovative scientific research projects that explore the role of microbiota and, in particular, the impact of its imbalance on the occurrence or evolution of various pathologies. To do so, the Foundation gathers both international and national boards of independent experts who select the most innovative fundamental or applied research projects to be awarded grants. In 2021, Biocodex Microbiota Foundation launched Henri Boulard Award To foster its commitment to improving global health, the Biocodex Microbiota Foundation launches in 2021 the Henri Boulard Award. Henri Boulard was the famous French microbiologist who discovered the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii in the 1920s in Indochina and its virtues against diarrhoea. The Henri Boulard Award honors this memory, and it is dedicated to improving the management of disorders associated with microbiota.

The CLP conservation partners share a common concern for, and a commitment to, our natural environment and its constituent biodiversity. To be effective, CLP requires a wide range of experience, expertise and networks. This is provided by the combined resources of the CLP conservation partners. These organisations recognise that by working together, sharing expertise and pooling resources, they can deliver programme objectives far more effectively than through separate efforts. BirdLife InternationalBirdLife International is the world’s largest nature conservation Partnership, with 116 BirdLife Partners in 113 countries. BirdLife is driven by its belief that local people, working for nature in their own places but connected nationally and internationally through the global Partnership, are the key to sustaining all life on this planet. This unique local-to-global approach delivers high impact and long-term conservation for the benefit of nature and people. Fauna & Flora InternationalFauna & Flora International (FFI) is the world’s longest established international wildlife conservation organisation. Founded in 1903, FFI acts to conserve threatened species and ecosystems worldwide. Renowned for an approach underpinned by robust science, FFI has pioneered collaborative, partnership-based, community-led conservation that tackles problems holistically, providing sustainable solutions that simultaneously benefit wildlife, support local livelihoods and safeguard the natural landscapes and seascapes on which we all ultimately depend. Wildlife Conservation SocietyThe Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.

The competition for the 2022 CLP Team Awards is now closed. Our next call for applications is expected to be announced in July 2022. ********************************************************************** About the CLP Team Awards Each year, CLP calls for applications to support projects in low- and middle-income countries and some high-income islands in the Caribbean and Pacific. Funding is awarded to teams of early-career conservationists to conduct scientific research, encourage and promote pro-conservation attitudes and deliver tangible results to better conserve and manage the natural world. There are three grant levels to allow teams to scale up their initial projects. Starting with a Future Conservationist Award, teams are supported to undertake small-scale research and awareness-raising projects. Through Follow-up and Leadership awards, teams can implement larger projects over a longer period of time and deliver practical solutions to conservation issues whilst learning to command more complex decision-making, communication and leadership skills. Each year we receive a high number of applications for our Team Awards, making it a highly competitive process. Below we provide data on how many applications we received in the last two years and how many of these went on to be selected for an award. Professional Development, Mentoring and Networking In addition to awarding project funding, CLP invites one member of each award-winning team to our annual international training course. Here, they learn about a range of conservation management and leadership topics as well as build a network with other early-career conservationists. Our training course helps awardees deliver their CLP projects and has also been credited for furthering participants’ career progression. It is a rewarding and life-changing experience! As part of the award, winning teams are able to access expertise from within each of our three conservation partner organisations and via our global Alumni Network, which includes past award-winners. Programme staff members are also available to advise on project implementation, including guidance required during the planning and team training stages. The Kate Stokes Memorial Award The Kate Stokes Memorial Award is an additional grant set up in the memory of Kate Stokes.

Fundado em 1925 pela iniciativa de um estudante da Universidade de Heidelberg, o DAAD é hoje uma das principais organizações de promoção de intercâmbios acadêmicos e científicos. Desde a sua fundação, o DAAD apoiou mais de 2,6 milhões de estudantes dentro e fora da Alemanha. Instituído como uma associação, o DAAD é mantido por universidades e organizações de estudantes alemãs. A atuação do DAAD vai muito além da concessão de bolsas de estudos: o DAAD fomenta a internacionalização das universidades alemãs, fortalece a área de Germanística (Letras com licenciatura em alemão) e literatura alemãs no exterior, apoia os países em desenvolvimento na construção de universidades fortes e assessora os responsáveis por áreas como política educativa, política científica exterior e políticas de desenvolvimento. Bolsas de estudos para os melhores alunos O DAAD possibilita que os jovens de dentro e de fora da Alemanha obtenham experiência internacional de estudo e pesquisa. A maioria dos bolsistas estrangeiros do DAAD é composta por estudantes de mestrado e doutorado. A oferta de bolsas de pós-graduação é maior por se entender que tais estudantes têm maior vivência e experiência em pesquisa do que aqueles ainda em início da formação acadêmica, tirando assim maior proveito do período de intercâmbio. Bolsas de estudos para estudantes internacionais em nível de graduação são raras. Ampla rede de contato Os recursos para as bolsas de estudos provêm, em primeiro lugar, de fundos federais de diferentes ministérios, como o Ministério Alemão de Relações Exteriores, da União Europeia e de organizações e governos estrangeiros. O escritório central do DAAD está localizado em Bonn, mas o DAAD mantém também um escritório em Berlim. Uma ampla rede de escritórios regionais e centros de informação mantêm o contato com os principais países parceiros, além de oferecer assessoria e atendimento local.

One aspect that is always important is to have an innovative project idea. You can apply for funding for your research project via Interner Linktheme-focused project funding, optionally including funds to cover a Interner LinkTemporary Position for Principal Investigators. The instruments of Interner Linkinvestigator-focused funding for the support of research careers are – in addition to funding your research project – particularly designed to advance your scientific career.Who does the DFG fund?The DFG funds doctorate-holding researchers of all nationalities whose proposal has successfully completed the review process. Funding can be claimed at a higher education institution or a non-university research institution in Germany, and also abroad under certain funding programmes.For some DFG programmes there are special requirements for submitting a proposal: these are to be found in the Interner Linkdescription of the individual programmes. Overview Individual funding offered by the DFG Finding the right funding programme Tips for your proposal Proposal information Arriving at a decision Approval or rejection – what now? Contact us! TIP You can submit your DFG proposal as soon as you have handed in your doctoral thesis. In the event of approval, however, funding can only be claimed once the doctorate has been completed and proof of this has been submitted to the DFG. You cannot submit a proposal of your own to the DFG before completing a doctorate, e.g. during your studies or for the purpose of obtaining a doctoral thesis. In these cases, only indirect funding is available, for instance via a position that is part of a funded project. What does the DFG fund?The DFG funds knowledge-driven research in all disciplines and does not usually specify topics. For most funding programmes, proposals can be submitted at any time. You are essentially free to decide what you want to investigate and the scope of your research as well as when, where and how you wish to pursue your project. However, a project will only receive funding if it can prevail over other projects in scientific competition. The Interner Linkbasic principles and framework conditions of DFG funding apply to all funding formats. No funding is provided for research in an industrial context. Did you know? In our GEPRIS database you can take a look at which people and projects are already being funded in your subject area or at your institution. What is the DFG?The DFG is the self-governing organisation for science and research in Germany. It serves all branches of science and the humanities. In organisational terms, the DFG is an association under private law. Its membership consists of German research universities, non-university research institutions, scientific associations and the Academies of Science and the Humanities. The DFG receives the large majority of its funds from the federal government and the states.If you want to learn more about the organization and the tasks of the DFG, please continue reading under Interner Link""DFG in Profile"".How does the DFG arrive at its decisions?The only criterion that counts towards funding decisions is that of scientific quality. Researchers determine the topics of their projects themselves. The Interner Linkpath to arriving at a decision is a multi-stage process. Reviewers and Interner Linkreview boards assess the scientific quality and originality of the projects, thereby providing the basis for a funding decision. These decisions are made by Interner Linkcommittees made up of scientists and politicians, though the former are in the majority. Did you know? The DFG offers a wide range of funding programmes. For example, there are also opportunities to obtain funding for coordinated collaborative projects, new international collaborations, infrastructures and scientific events. Further questions?

If you want to deliver the application personally or by courier, please contact us by e-mail or by telephone (+46 70 240 81 81) at least one week before the deadline so we can give you a current delivery address. The application can be made in Swedish or English, but it is probably a slight advantage to write in Swedish (if possible) as most people on our scientific advisory council have Swedish as their mother tongue. 1. Application form Every year an updated application form can be downloaded from our website - see link at the bottom of this page. There you will also find detailed instructions on how to fill in the form as well as a checklist. The summary of the project has to describe the application in a popular scientific way (lay summary), meaning that you should not need to have detailed knowledge of the subject in order to understand the application. It is also important to describe in which ways the project contributes to public health, why the application is relevant for Ekhagastiftelsen and how it matches our prioritized research areas. For example how does the application contribute to improving the self-healing capabilities? 2. Application data sheet The information from the application form is also to be entered into the application data sheet (Excel-template) that can be downloaded - see link at the bottom of this page. Note! The application data sheet must be sent as an Excel-file in Excel-format (.xlsx or .xls)! 3. Project description There is no form or template for this document.

Which idea or vision is to be tested or further developed? » What is the hypothesis? » Goal or purpose/aim » How it the project relevant with respect to the aims of the foundation? » Present situation, current international knowledge/research (including references) and conclusions. » Material and methods » Expected results and their importance/significance. How are the results to be evaluated? How will the project be documented and disseminated? » Time plan » Budget and information about financing from other organizations. At the end of the project description the qualifications and references of the applicant and co-applicants should be stated, especially within the area that the foundation supports. This is often done through a CV The project description including any appendices and supplements has to be sent as one (1) PDF-file.If the project description is sent in any other data format or as more than one file the application will be returned. Description of relevance The project description must include a section that describes why the application is relevant for Ekhagastiftelsen, how it matches our prioritized research areas and in which ways the project contributes to public health. Budget Information about our budget requirements can be found on the page Budget. Applications from outside Europe Since 2019 it is no longer mandatory for applications that do not come from Europe to have a cooperation with a swedish institution. However we strongly recommend that you have a reserach cooperation with a swedish institution where the partner is involved in the research project. Please be sure to describe the details of the cooperation. Financing from other organizations Ekhagastiftelsen can award grants to projects where the foundation is one of several funders. Usually the foundation does not support projects where our contribution would only be a small part of the total budget. In the application form the applicant has to state information regarding grant received or applied for at other organizations. In the project description the applicant has to further elaborate this and for example answer some of the following issues and questions: raquo; How is a project/subproject interrelated when funds are applied for at Ekhagastiftelsen and other organizations for the same research area? What is Ekhagastiftelsens role/part of a larger funding? » What happens with the project if requested funds are not granted by Ekhagastiftelsen or other funders? Does the project need to receive financing from all funders in order to be carried out? » If grants are applied for at both Ekhagastiftelsen and other organizations and all applications are approved, can the funders contributions be reduced as the project has received more funding than needed to carry out the project? » When the project is already ongoing, for what/which parts is it that funds are sought? » What other funds have already been received and what have they been used for? » If Ekhagastiftelsen is only funding an early part of the project (for example: funds asked for are for data collection, but analysis is carried out later and funded by other organization) - which type of reporting is possible for the part of the project funded by Ekhagastiftelsen? When will the total project be finished and Ekhagastiftelsen able to receive information about the very final report? » To write that you are glad for and can make use of any amount received is not a relevant answer, but something we have actually heard from applicants. Amounts that can be applied for There is no maximum amount that an application should not exceed. Please note that in the last years the total amount awarded has been in the range 10-15 million SEK. Usually between 10 and 20 projects receive funding each year. Under the menu selection Research/Grants choose the All years tab for a list of the amounts that have been granted to specific projects in the past. If it is evaluated that the project can manage with a reduced budget, it can be that such an amount is awarded. If a grant recipient receives funding from other funders for the same project Ekhagastiftelsens grant can be reduced.

Evaluation of applications Applications are evaluated and prioritized by our scientific advisory council. Based upon the council's recommendations, the board takes decisions on awards of funds at its meeting in the fall (usually September-October). Prioritization criteria are: » The relevance of the project idea with respect to the aims of the foundation. » The framing of question for the project » The scientific quality of method and execution, including the applicants competence for the project and the time plan and budget presented. When evaluating the applications, the United Nations' sustainability goals are also taken into account. Projects that are to receive grants must not be in conflict with the UN's sustainability goals. Assessment of relevance The most important evaluation criteria is the relevance of the application with respect to the aims of the foundation. For detailed information about Ekhagastiftelsens aim and prioritized research areas see the page The foundation. Here we want to make some clarifications regarding relevance. » Research in animal husbandry is not a priority, unless there is a connection to the quality of the animal products. » Research regarding the environment is of lower relevance for the foundation. Support can be relevant to the extent as this has a positive effect on the capacity of the agricultural system (organic matter and biodiversity) in the long run to deliver ecosystem services that can reduce the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers as well as securing the quality of agricultural products. » Regarding the medical field, it should be mentioned that the founder Gösta Videgård repeatedly expressed a certain distrust of mainstream medicine. What he reacted against was particularly the use of drugs and medicines containing such agents which in his opinion could not be considered natural. » Gösta Videgård was opposed to artificial substances and poisons of all kinds. Clinical animal testing Ekhagastiftelsen has a restrictive attitude towards scientific research where clinical animal testing is used. This does not mean that such research can not be funded by Ekhagastiftelsen, but such research must have high relevance with respect to the aims of the foundation and not be able to carried out without animal testing.

It is allowed to do the detailed budget in other currencies than SEK (Swedish krona) provided that budget summary in the project description and the application form states costs in SEK. Approved expense categories Ekhagastiftelsen can grant funding for the following expense categories: 1. Salaries Direct costs for salaries for active staff in the project (including salary related costs that the employer has to pay for taxes or charges due to collective agreements - In Swedish: LKP - lönekostnadspålägg). Provide information about active persons in the project with their salaries and how much of their time is spent on the project. For example, person NN working 25% of his time in the project. Alternatively specify hours worked and hourly cost. For applications from Sweden: specify LKP separately as both amount and percentage of salaries. 2. Equipment, instruments, materials The foundation can fund the cost of equipment, instruments, consumables, etc. needed for the project. The budget shall include cost details, but on an overall level. For example, there is no need to list all the types of supplies that will be used. 3. Travel The foundation can fund the cost of travel, conferences, etc. that are required in the project. The budget must clearly state the purpose of the trips and the overall details. 4. Office and building costs The foundation can fund direct costs for office and building space for the project staff listed in the Salaries section. Office and building costs should be included as a separate section in the budget, although it is to be stated in the column 'Other' on the application form. 5. Other Other direct project-related costs such as for example financial management and IT systems. These other costs must be specified in the budget. Indirect/Overhead-costs Ekhagastiftelsen has a restrictive view about granting funds for overhead costs at universities and other institutions. We believe that grants should only be approved for costs directly related to the projects. Some indirect costs can be relevant, such as the costs of financial administration or IT, but must be specified. Unspecified or flat rate surcharges/fees/overhead in the budget will not be accepted (Swedish example: universitetspåslag). Nor does the foundation accept budget lines such as, for example, university / faculty / department-wide costs, costs for management, library, education, infrastructure, etc. We also presume that no surcharges are placed on the purchase of equipment and materials. Co-financing and grants from other organizations (if this exits) The budget shall include a specification of the contribution that the managing body, department, college or university gives to the project, so-called co-financing, for example in the form of salaries for other staff involved in the project.

This may include for example moorland, hills, mountains, coasts, rivers, forest, grassland, peatland, lake and ocean areas. More companies, bigger impact There are currently over 150 members of this 'not-for profit' Association, stretching from Norway to Spain and from the UK across to the Czech Republic. As a charitable organisation directly funding specific projects, the association wants to show that the European outdoor industry is committed to putting something back into the environment, and all working together a real difference can be made. Conservation bodies which are nominated by Association members can apply for grants of up to €30,000 for specific projects - not an insignificant amount as far as conservation projects go. The projects chosen are as wide ranging as the members, with projects extending across many areas of the globe, for example, thus far projects have included the establishment of an environmental trail in Nepal, clean-up operations on a mountain peak in Kyrgyzstan, the protection of brown bears in northern Spain, replanting of native ‘virgin’ forest in the Czech Republic, creation of a trans-boundary hiking trail in Macedonia and Albania, protection of marsh fritillaries in Ireland and the saving of an ancient forest in Sweden from logging. View above the clouds Membership is open to any company operating within the outdoor industry, whether they are a manufacturer, supplier, service provider or retailer etc. One hundred per cent of membership fees go directly into the projects that are nominated by and voted for by the members themselves. As awareness of climate change and the damage man is doing to the environment grows, the importance of the work that the European Outdoor Conservation Association does increases. The more companies that get involved, the bigger the impact will be and the more difference the industry can make to the great outdoors that it depends on. Print this page Back to top",About Us

In attendance were: Lonnie Poole (Waste Industries), Patrick Banfield (Banfield and Associates), Gene Wingerter (National Solid Waste Management Association), Bob Duncan (J.C. Duncan Companies), Izzie Abrams (Dual Removal Systems, Ltd.), Whit Hudson (Hudson Management Company) and Lee Brandsma (Groot Industries).They created what was then called the National Solid Waste Management Association Foundation because they accepted the premise that research by the waste industry was so small that it was judged to be insignificant; and to fill the information gap, these early leaders designed the foundation which would serve as a subsidiary and resource for NSWMA and, later, the Environmental Industry Associations.This changed in 1998 when the board of directors voted to make the foundation independent of the trade association and renamed it the Environmental Research and Education Foundation.

Our research grants program is led by our Research Council, a body of volunteers consisting of technical experts in industry, academia and consulting. The work of the Council is guided by a long range strategic plan with the goal to achieve greater sustainability, good environmental stewardship, higher process efficiency and increased knowledge. Council recommended projects are then reviewed by our Board\xe2\x80\x99s Projects Committee for a final review and funding allocation. Non-research oriented projects are reviewed and recommended to the Projects Committee by technical staff.EREF Research CouncilThe EREF Board of Directors (BOD) has recognized that while Board members are very familiar with the solid waste industry, many may not necessarily be technical experts. Thus, the Research Council was formed as a sub-committee of technical experts to assist the BOD in funding high quality research projects and identify industry research needs. Although the Research Council has technically been in existence since 2007, Council members have noted previous attempts at organization had a number of apparent issues, specifically:a lack of definitive structureover burdening Council members with too many proposals over too short a review periodan inefficient or vague review format and proposal rating systemDuring the December 2008 Board of Directors meeting, the EREF technical staff was asked to prepare a report proposing how the Research Council would function. In consideration of this, it quickly became evident that the Research Council should be a primary and integral component of the entire research program if it were to be successful and have the necessary structure desired by the Board.Thus, re-structuring the Research Council also required re-structuring the EREF research program. As a result, a framework was established with the Board of Directors providing strategic guidance and the Research Council providing technical guidance. The goal of this framework was to provide a detailed protocol for proposal submission, review, recommendation and funding. In addition, appropriate mechanisms were established for ongoing project review and assessment of completed projects and the structure and governance of the Research Council were materialized. All primary elements of the proposed structure were reviewed and approved by the Research Council and the EREF Board of Directors in mid-2009.Current Research Council MembersCurrent Research Council members are listed below.Debbie Reinhart (University of Central Florida)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 ChairmanJim Frey (RRS)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Vice ChairmanBob Gardner (SCS Engineers) \xe2\x80\x93 Past ChairmanMorton Barlaz (North Carolina State University)Craig Benson (University of Wisconsin-Madison)Garth Bowers (Tetra-Tech, Inc.

Who better to do this than ENGIE, one of the world’s leading energy players…More than ever, the ENGIE Foundation believes we need to be optimistic and work together to find solutions for the future. In a world facing many challenges, including global warming, migration, biodiversity conservation, access to energy for all and tackling poverty, we believe that the energy required to drive the most useful, necessary and ambitious projects must be unleashed as a matter of urgency. This is the mission of the ENGIE Foundation, and it is also the vision shared by all ENGIE employees around the world. Children and young people in need, access to energy for all, and biodiversitySince its creation, the ENGIE Foundation has been mobilising energies to help the weakest and most vulnerable. Its primary focus has been children and young people in need, giving them the confidence to grow by supporting projects that promote inclusion through culture, education, health or sport. Support for children is in keeping with the Foundation’s philosophy: children will build the world of tomorrow, so giving them the energy to act is vital to the future of the planet. In recent years, the ENGIE Foundation has evolved to take up new challenges: access to energy for all and protecting biodiversity. Like support for children, these are crucial challenges for the future of our planet and its sustainable growth. Emergency assistance and support for refugeesClimate crises in places such as Haiti are becoming increasingly commonplace. This is something that the ENGIE Foundation felt unable to ignore. Part of its budget has therefore been set aside for emergency assistance, as distinct from the projects supported under agreements with our partners. With migration on the rise worldwide, the Foundation is also committed to assisting migrants and refugees, whether driven by economic, political or climatic factors. Supporting projects led by womenOf the world’s 800 million illiterate individuals, 75% are women. And yet women are often the linchpins of development. They are innovators who work hard to improve the day-to-day lives of their families. Consequently, women often play a key role in projects supported by the ENGIE Foundation, whether promoting the social inclusion of children or access to energy for all. « The ENGIE Foundation is one of the first corporate foundations created in France. It has maintained its course since its inception, and this course chosen 30 years ago continues to be relevant, in line with societal needs. More than ever, it seems important to maintain it, by seeking again and again to reinforce the impact of our actions in the field. »— Bernard Guirkinger, Vice President of the ENGIE Foundation Over 1,000 projects in 25 years, in 25 countriesSince its creation, the ENGIE Foundation has supported some 1,000 projects, charitable organisations and institutions. So many encounters and shared adventures, so many smiles and emotions, so many lives transformed. And as the years go by, more stories continue to be written… and more energy is unleashed to build a better world for the future.

220329,fondationengie_220329_3_001,https://fondation-engie.com/en/impact-as-an-engine-social-and-environmental/,fondationengie,"Impact as an engineHow to measure social and environmental impact of programs? Wich indicators? This question is at the heart of ENGIE Foundation’s concerns. Beyond the number of beneficiaries reached, it is a question of understanding how a museum’s visit, listening to a concert or electrifying a village have a real and long-term impact, on beneficiarie’s life, but also on all of the project’s stakeholders and on a given territory. For all projects, ENGIE Foundation attaches increasing importance to the evaluation of actions. Each agreement signed with a partner thus includes the obligation to submit, once a year, an evaluation file to verify that results are in line with the set objectives. This rigor and transparency are essential, both with regard to shareholders and employees of ENGIE Group. Since 2019, ENGIE Foundation has been carrying out in-depth work to set up identical monitoring indicators that apply to all projects, regardless of the field of intervention or the public. This work will be finalized during 2020. Here some elements on the guiding principles that will guide the reflection: 1. Take into account a triple impact 2. Distinguish between actions and results 3. Set realistic goals and build on results to make progress Taking into account a triple impact– The social impact on beneficiaries Who benefited from the programme and how? Direct and indirect beneficiaries? We refine our criterion to see, for example, beyond access to education, what educational results, what effectiveness in giving a chance to – Environnemental Impact within the ecosystem Has the programme inspired other initiatives? Did it bring together more actors as it progressed? Has it advanced the cause or advocacy and how? – The impact on ENGIE group’s employees or on the Foundation’s other partner associations How were they involved? A project is in fact the meeting between the project leader, the beneficiaries and the Foundation. How does it work, how does it advance our shared objective? This is what we measure throughout. « TO EVALUATE OUR PHILANTHROPIC PERFORMANCE, WE ASK OURSELVES 3 QUESTIONS.» Philippe Peyrat General Delegate of ENGIE Foundation Distinguishing actions from results– The actions correspond to an inventory of the actions carried out (e.g., number of concerts or educational actions supported, number of photovoltaic panels installed) and the number of beneficiaries reached (direct and indirect beneficiaries). – The results correspond to the “real” impact of the actions: how have they made it possible to change the lives of the beneficiaries over time? How have they made it possible to change their behaviour or skills? For example: number of people coming out of poverty, improvement in school results, etc. « The number of beneficiaries is not the totality of actions. At the Opera, we are not in the race for the number of beneficiaries. It’s a choice, we prefer to work in the long term, to have a real impact on lives. Moreover, the study conducted with Sciences Po and the CNRS has shown that the 10 year course at the Opera had a positive impact on the results of the secondary school certificate. » Myriam Mazouzi, Director of the Paris Opera Academy Set realistic goals and build on results to make progressIt is, sure, essential to set indicators to measure the impact. Each indicator must also be associated with a target for achievement. It is not necessarily easy to set a “course” for each indicator. Setting targets in terms of reducing the poverty rate is more complex than defining the number of photovoltaic panels to be installed. Setting targets in terms of acquiring “soft skills” for disadvantaged children is more complex than agreeing on a number of educational actions. However, it is essential to set a course. This is what enables progress to be made. Indeed, it is by analysing the differences between objectives and achievements that corrective measures can be implemented… to increase their social and environmental impact. Life beyond numbersBehind each “beneficiary” is a child, a family, a woman, with her story, her ills, her joys and her obstacles. Sometimes, culture, sport or education creates the trigger that changes life. Often, energy is the trigger to get out of poverty. But one thing is certain, to have a lasting social and environnemental impact, it is better to work for the long term. This is why ENGIE Foundation prefers support programmes over the long term, on agreements of at least two years. Far from “zapping” philanthropy. It is also keen to meet the “beneficiaries” in the field, via the ENGIE group’s regional delegations and in partnership with its partners. Key success factors according to the ENGIE Foundation– Long-term support: no “zapping” support but long-term support for beneficiaries – Betting on excellence and commitment: beneficiaries are accompanied by the best mediators or experts. In exchange, they are ready to commit to creating a project. – Anchoring in the territories: networking with stakeholders in each territory helps to anchor projects and multiply their social and environmental impact. « The ability to build and get involved together is also a guarantee project impact. The impact starts with motivation and temperament of the project’s leaders. The more project leaders are involved, the more project will flourish in the long term. » Chekeba Hachemi, President of Afghanistan Libre, Director of ENGIE Foundation",Impact as an engine

Each agreement includes the obligation to submit an evaluation file once a year, to check whether the results obtained meet the objectives set. If an association is committed to integrating 40 children in precarious situations, it will have to prove that it did so, on very specific criteria (passing an exam, entering the labor market, etc.). If we notice too great a gap between the results and the objectives, without clear explanations, it may happen that we terminate the agreement during the program. This is part of our obligation and of our philosophy of transparency… and also of the accounts that we must render to our employees.

Tras la I Reunión Extraordinaria de los Cancilleres de Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Paraguay y Uruguay fue suscrito el Tratado de la Cuenca del Plata, en Brasilia en el 23 de abril de 1969.Este documento entró en vigencia el 14 de agosto de 1970, al unir esfuerzos para promover el desarrollo económico en la sub-región. Los países miembros formularon entendimientos operativos e instrumentos jurídicos para identificar áreas de interés común en la región.Convenio ConstitutivoLos gobiernos de Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Paraguay y Uruguay organizaron la IV Reunión de cancilleres en Asunción, el 6 de junio de 1971, para “crear una entidad con Personería Jurídica Internacional que se denominaría: Fondo Financiero para el Desarrollo de los Países de la Cuenca del Plata, FONPLATA”.Durante la VI Reunión, realizada en Buenos Aires el 12 de junio de 1974, los Cancilleres suscribieron el Convenio Constitutivo de FONPLATA, de naturaleza jurídica internacional y duración ilimitada.FONPLATA comenzó a operar en 1977, al entrar en vigencia el Convenio de Sede con el Gobierno de Bolivia, estableciéndose inicialmente su base en Sucre, su capital.En diciembre de 2002, con la Resolución Nº 56 de la VII Reunión de Cancilleres de los países de la Cuenca del Plata y la decisión del Comité Intergubernamental Coordinador de los Países de la Cuenca del Plata, en su 529ª Sesión Ordinaria, se ratificó a la República de Bolivia como País Sede del Organismo.En 2010, los Gobernadores de FONPLATA adoptaron dotar el Organismo de un nuevo modelo de gestión institucional y crear el cargo de Presidente Ejecutivo.Con la admisión del primer Presidente Ejecutivo, en 2012, la nueva administración ha generado una agenda estructurada y articulada de sus órganos de gobernanza para relanzar institucionalmente al Banco a partir de un cronograma con metas de gestión a corto plazo. Como resultado de este compromiso, la Asamblea de Gobernadores aprobó el Plan Estratégico Institucional de largo plazo (PEI) y dos incrementos de capital.En diciembre de 2014, el organismo obtuvo un crédito de US$75 millones por parte de CAF, Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina. Estos fondos permitieron el fortalecimiento institucional de FONPLATA, la expansión de la cartera de crédito y la ejecución de proyectos de infraestructura, desarrollo social y productivo en sus países miembros.El 1 de agosto de 2013 la Asamblea de Gobernadores aprobó un aumento de capital de FONPLATA por un monto de US$1.150 millones, y el 28 de enero de 2016, FONPLATA recibió otro aumento de capital, superando los US$3.000 millones.En 2016 FONPLATA obtuvo por primera vez una calificación de crédito internacional, registrando A2 por Moody’s y A- por Standard & Poor’s. Para Moody’s, la calificación se ha mantenido estable desde su origen permitiéndole al Banco acceder y otorgar financiamientos en condiciones ventajosas. Por la parte de Standard & Poor’s, en un informe del 21 de febrero de 2019, se ratificó la calificación de FONPLATA de A- para largo plazo y A-2 para corto plazo modificando la perspectiva de estable a positiva. El 27 de septiembre de 2021, Standard & Poor’s eleva las calificaciones del Banco a A/A-1 sustentada en el fortalecimiento de las capacidades operativas de FONPLATA y de su marco de administración de riesgos.En noviembre de 2018, se consolidó bajo el nombre de FONPLATA - Banco de Desarrollo mediante la modificación del Convenio Constitutivo para establecer alianzas estratégicas con nuevos países miembros, así como con otras agencias y bancos multilaterales de crédito que compartan sus valores institucionales y objetivos de desarrollo por la región.

Inicialmente, em função do pioneirismo tecnológico do país em monitorar as mudanças na cobertura florestal, realizado pelo Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais – INPE, desde 1988, e também pelos recentes êxitos de ações que ocasionaram a reversão do incremento das taxas anuais de desmatamento, algumas delas abaixo descritas. O Plano de Ação para Prevenção e Controle do Desmatamento na Amazônia Legal - PPCDAM O Plano de Ação para Prevenção e Controle do Desmatamento na Amazônia Legal - PPCDAM, lançado em 2004 como resposta governamental às crescentes taxas de desmatamento na Amazônia tem como objetivo promover a redução das taxas de desmatamento, é um arranjo de ação governamental cujos resultados contribuíram significativamente para a queda do desmatamento, obtendo, por exemplo, uma redução de 71% da taxa de desmatamento no período 2005-2016. O PPCDAM envolve iniciativas organizadas em quatro principais estratégias de implementação, envolvendo: Fomento a atividades produtivas sustentáveis Monitoramento e controle ambiental Ordenamento fundiário e territorial Instrumentos Normativos e Econômicos O PPCDAm passou por um processo de avaliação e revisão devido à necessidade de atualizá-lo frente às mudanças ocorridas na dinâmica do desmatamento, ao amadurecimento das ações e aos êxitos já alcançados nas três primeiras fases, dando origem à quarta fase do Plano, na qual foi criado o quarto eixo, instrumentos normativos e econômicos, cujo objetivo é criar mecanismos que incentivem a economia de base florestal e que contribuam para o desenvolvimento de uma matriz produtiva, economicamente competitiva e com menor impacto possível sobre a floresta. Para ver os documentos do PPCDAM na íntegra, clique nos links abaixo: PPCDAM - 1ª fase (2004 a 2008) PPCDAM - 2ª fase (2009 a 2011) PPCDAM - 3a fase (2012-2015) PPCDAM - 4a fase (2016) Plano Operativo 2016-2020 ESTRATÉGIA NACIONAL de redd+ (ENREDD+) Outro marco importante observado pelo Fundo Amazônia é a Estratégia Nacional para Redução das Emissões Provenientes do Desmatamento e da Degradação Florestal, Conservação dos Estoques de Carbono Florestal, Manejo Sustentável de Florestas e Aumento de Estoques de Carbono Florestal - ENREDD+, instituída pela Portaria MMA nº 370, de 2 de dezembro de 2015 e que tem como objetivo geral contribuir para a mitigação da mudança do clima por meio da eliminação do desmatamento e da promoção da conservação, da recuperação dos ecossistemas florestais e do desenvolvimento de uma economia florestal sustentável de baixo carbono, gerando benefícios econômicos, sociais e ambientais. A ENREDD+ visa habilitar o Brasil a acessar os incentivos para REDD+ acordados no âmbito da Convenção-Quadro, por meio da coordenação e da promoção de sinergias entre as diversas políticas públicas que têm como objetivo reverter a perda de florestas. A estratégia prevê três objetivos específicos: Aprimorar o monitoramento e a análise de impacto de políticas públicas para o alcance dos resultados de REDD+, buscando maximizar sua contribuição para a mitigação da mudança global do clima, observadas as salvaguardas socioeconômicas e ambientais acordadas na UNFCCC. Integrar as estruturas de gestão das políticas para mudança do clima, florestas e biodiversidade, buscando promover convergência e complementariedade entre elas nos níveis federal, estadual e municipal. Contribuir para a mobilização de recursos em escala compatível com o compromisso nacional voluntário de mitigar emissões de gases de efeito estufa nos biomas brasileiros até 2020, estabelecido na Política Nacional sobre Mudança do Clima. Planos Estaduais de Combate ao Desmatamento A elaboração dos planos de combate ao desmatamento dos estados amazônicos, contou com a orientação do governo federal que estabeleceu, inicialmente, três eixos principais de ações: ordenamento territorial, controle ambiental e fomento às atividades produtivas sustentáveis. Seu objetivo é garantir o cumprimento das metas previstas em âmbito nacional no Plano de Prevenção e Controle de Desmatamento (PPCDAM). Para os estados terem direito a voto nas deliberações do Comitê Orientador do Fundo Amazônia - COFA, precisam contar com um plano estadual de combate ao desmatamento (inciso II do artigo 4º do Decreto nº 6.527, de 1º de agosto de 2008, que criou o Fundo Amazônia).

Plano Amazônia Sustentável - PAS Complementarmente ao PPCDAM, a sociedade da região vem discutindo, desde o ano de 2003, as diretrizes para um novo modelo de desenvolvimento, consubstanciadas no Plano Amazônia Sustentável - PAS, cujo lançamento oficial se realizou em 2008. O PAS reúne um conjunto de diretrizes estratégicas, elaborados a partir de um diagnóstico atualizado da Amazônia contemporânea e de seus desafios, para referenciar as políticas governamentais, os investimentos privados e o atendimento às demandas da sociedade. Como pacto formado entre os governos estaduais e federais seu principal objetivo é constituir-se como lócus institucional capaz de dar respostas de longo prazo para os desafios da região. As diretrizes estratégicas para o desenvolvimento sustentável da Amazônia brasileira, conforme proposto no Plano, estão agrupadas em 4 eixos temáticos: Ordenamento Territorial e Gestão Ambiental; Produção Sustentável com Inovação e Competitividade; Infra-Estrutura para o Desenvolvimento; e Inclusão Social e Cidadania.",Políticas públicas orientadoras
220430,futureoflife_220430_3_000,https://futureoflife.org/grants-faq/,futureoflife,"An International Request for Proposals – Frequently Asked Questions Does FLI have particular agenda or position on AI safety? FLI’s position is well summarized by the open letter that FLI’s founders and many of its advisory board members have signed. The research program is aimed at the goals expressed in that letter, and toward the sort of research described in the attached research priorities document. Who is eligible for grants? Researchers and outreach specialists working in academic and other non-profit institutions are eligible, as well as independent researchers. Grant awards are sent to the PI’s institution and the institution’s administration is responsible for disbursing the awards to the PI. When submitting your application, please make sure to list the appropriate grant administrator that we should contact at your institution. If you are not affiliated with a research institution, there are many organizations that will help administer your grant. If you need suggestions, please contact FLI. Applicants are *not* required to be affiliated with an institution for the Initial Proposal, only for the Full Proposal. Can researchers from outside the U.S. apply? Yes, applications will be welcomed from any country. Please note that the US Government imposes restrictions on the types of organizations to which US nonprofits (such as FLI) can give grants. Given this, if you are awarded a grant, your institution must a) prove their equivalency to a non-profit institution by providing the institution’s establishing law or charter, list of key staff and board members, and a signed affidavit for public universities and, b) comply with the U.S. Patriot Act. Please note that this is included to provide information about the equivalency determination process that will take place if you are awarded a grant. If there are any issues with your granting institution proving its equivalency, FLI can help provide a list of organizations that can act as a go-between to administer the grant. More detail about international grant compliance is available on our website here. Please contact FLI if you have any questions about whether your institution is eligible, to get a list of organizations that can help administer your grant, or if you want to review the affidavit that public universities must fill out. Can I submit an application in a language other than English? All proposals must be in English. Since our grant program has an international focus, we will not penalize applications by people who do not speak English as their first language. We will encourage the review panel to be accommodating of language differences when reviewing applications. All applications must be coherent. How and when do we apply? Apply online here. Please submit an Initial Proposal by March 1, 2015. After screening, you may then be invited to submit a Full Proposal, due May 17, 2015. Please see Section IV for more information. What kinds of programs and requests are eligible for funding? Acceptable use of grant funds for Project Grants include: Student/postdoc/researcher salary and benefits Summer salary and teaching buyout for academics Support for specific projects during sabbaticals Assistance in writing or publishing books or journal articles, including page charges Modest allowance for justifiable lab equipment, computers, and other research supplies Modest travel allowance Development of workshops, conferences, or lecture series for professionals in the relevant fields Overhead of at most 15% (Please note if this is an issue with your institution, or if your organization is not non-profit, you can contact FLI to learn about other organizations that can help administer an FLI grant for you.) Subawards are discouraged in the case of Project Grants, but perfectly acceptable for Center Grants. What is your policy on overhead? The highest allowed overhead rate is 15%. (As mentioned before, if this is an issue with your institution, you can contact FLI to learn about other organizations that can help administer FLI grants.) How will proposals be judged? After screening of the Initial Proposal, applicants may be asked to submit a Full Proposal. All Full Proposals will undergo a competitive process of external and confidential expert peer review. An expert panel will evaluate and rank the reviews according to the criteria described in Section III of the RFP overview. Will FLI provide feedback on initial proposals? FLI will generally not provide significant feedback on initial Project Proposals, but is likely to provide significant feedback on initial Center Proposals. Please keep in mind that however positive FLI may be about a proposal at any stage, it may still be turned down for funding after peer review. Can I submit multiple proposals? We will consider multiple Initial Proposals from the same PI; however, we will invite at most one Full Proposal from each PI or closely associated group of applicants. What if I am unable to submit my application electronically? Only applications submitted through the form on our website are accepted. If you encounter problems, please contact FLI. Is there a maximum amount of money for which we can apply? No. You may apply for as much money as you think is necessary to achieve your goals. However, you should carefully justify your proposed expenditure. Keep in mind that projects will be assessed on potential impact per dollar requested; an inappropriately high budget may harm the proposal’s prospects, effectively pricing it out of the market. Referees are authorized to suggest budget adjustments. As mentioned in the RFP overview, there may be an opportunity to apply for greater follow-up funding. What will an average award be? We expect that Project awards will typically be in the range of $100,000-$500,000 total over the life of the award (usually two to three years). We expect that Center awards will be larger, of order $500,000-$1,500,000. What are the reporting requirements? Grantees will be asked to submit a progress report (if a multi-year Grantee) and/or annual report consisting of narrative and financial reports. Renewal of multi-year grants will be contingent on satisfactory demonstration in these reports that the supported research is progressing appropriately, and continues to be consistent with the spirit of the original proposal. (see below question regarding renewal.) How are multi-year grants renewed? This program has been formulated to maximize impact by re-allocating (and potentially adding) resources during each year of the grant program. Decisions regarding the renewal of multi-year grants will be made by a review committee on the basis of the annual progress report. This report is not pro-forma. The committee is likely to recommend that some grants not be renewed, some be renewed at reduced level, some renewed at the same level, and that some be offered the opportunity for increased funding in later years. What are the qualifications for a Principal Investigator? A Principal Investigator can be anyone — there are no qualification requirements (though qualifications will be taken into account during the review process). Lacking conventional academic credentials or publications does *not* disqualify a P.I. We encourage applications from industry and independent researchers. Please list any relevant experience or achievements in the attached resume/CV. As noted above, Principal Investigators need not even be affiliated with a university or non-profit. If a PI is affiliated with an academic institution, then their Principal Investigator status must be allowed by their institution. Should they be invited to submit a Full Proposal, they must obtain co-signatures on the proposal from the department head, as well as a department host with a post exceeding the duration of the grant. My colleague(s) and I would like to apply as co-PIs. Can we do this? Yes. For administrative purposes, however, please select a primary contact for the life of the award. The primary contact, which must be a Principal Investigator, will be the reference for your application(s) and all future correspondence, documents, etc. Will the grants pay for laboratory or computational expenses? Yes, however due to budgetary limitations FLI cannot fund capital-intensive equipment or computing facilities. Also, such expenses must be clearly required by the proposed research. I have a proposal for my usual, relatively mainstream AI research program that I may be able to repackage as an appropriate proposal for this FLI program. Sound OK? FLI is very sensitive to the problem of “fishing for money”—that is, the re-casting of an existing research program to make it appear to fit the overall thematic nature of this Request For Proposals. Such proposals will not be funded, nor renewed if erroneously funded initially. Do proposals have to be as long as possible? Please note that the page limit (15 pages for project proposals and 20 for center proposals) is an *upper limit*, not a lower limit. You should simply write as much as you feel that you need in order to explain your proposal in sufficient detail for the review panel to understand it properly. What are the “referees” in the instructions? If there are specific reviewers whom you feel are particularly qualified to evaluate your proposal, please feel free to list them (this is completely optional) Who are FLI’s reviewers? FLI follows the standard practice of protecting the identities of our external reviewers and selecting them based on expertise in the relevant research areas. For example, the external reviewers in the first-round of this RFP were highly qualified experts in AI, law and economics, mostly professors and also some industry experts.",An International Request for Proposals – Frequently Asked Questions

Estimates show that infrastructure investment needs in developing countries could range from 2 percent to 8 percent of GDP per year by 2030. These investments will be crucial to meet the global demand for reliable electricity, transportation, telecommunication, and water services. Yet millions of people are facing the consequences of unreliable electricity grids, inadequate water and sanitation systems, and overstrained transport networks. Natural hazards magnify the challenges faced by these fragile systems. In low- and middle-income countries, direct damage to power generation and transport infrastructure caused by disaster events amounts to $18 billion per year, with additional household and firm costs amounting to $390 billion annually due to infrastructure damage and service disruptions. Improving the quality and resilience of essential infrastructure services is key to contribute to more resilient and prosperous societies. GFDRR’s Global Program on Resilient Infrastructure (GPRI) is mainstreaming disaster risk management (DRM) across multiple infrastructure sectors, promoting resilient infrastructure through targeted knowledge, tools and operational support. To improve infrastructure resilience in developing countries, GFDRR is working across World Bank Global Practices (GP) to open access to DRM technical and financial resources for investments in energy, transport, water, and the built environment. The program will aim at providing task teams and clients with access to cutting edge methods and best practices by promoting a knowledge sharing and networking environment in addition to direct support from the GPRI to specific projects. The program promotes resilience in infrastructure investments by bringing together sectoral specialists and DRM experts. Through this Global Program, GFDRR supports national and local governments, infrastructure owners and operators to mitigate disaster risk throughout the lifecycle of infrastructure assets. This is done by improving operations management practices, mitigating exposure of planned infrastructure, prioritizing disaster risk management investments based on risk mapping, increasing access to disaster resilient design standards, strengthening asset maintenance, and developing policy and institutional frameworks for infrastructure emergency preparedness and business continuity. │  ",Resilient Infrastructure

As losses associated with natural events continue to increase, the decisions that cities make now about investment, infrastructure, and land use are vital for increasing resilience. By helping cities both avoid losses from disasters, and prevent affected citizens from sliding into poverty, improved urban resilience can safeguard development gains for future generations. GFDRR's work on resilient cities supports cities in strengthening their ability to better manage ongoing stresses and prepare for, withstand, and recover from acute shocks. We also work with cities to develop tools and knowledge that help decision-makers and municipal leaders determine where to reform policies, and where and how to invest to increase their city’s resilience. Further, we also offer support that cuts across all sectors, taking a broad, inclusive approach to the highly interrelated challenges that cities face.  ",Resilient Cities

GWNET seeks to address the current gender imbalances in the energy sector and to promote gender-sensitive action around the energy transition in all parts of the world. History It is a well-known fact that the energy sector continues to be male-dominated. The absence of gender equality can be observed in all parts of the world. Gender inequality is even more prevalent at decision-making levels. Women are generally under-represented on company boards and across senior management positions, as well as in politics. This reality of under-representation is even more accentuated in energy-related fields. As a result, the few women that manage to secure top positions are often less connected with their peers than their male colleagues. It is important to note that gender equality has proven to be an indispensable factor in reaching sustainability. Gender diversity drives innovation, opens new pathways for technology deployment, brings fresh perspectives to the development of societies and attracts and retains a richer pool of talent. These observations motivated four women professionals working in the sustainable energy field to found the Global Women’s Network for the Energy Transition (GWNET). GWNET is a global network aiming at empowering women working in sustainable energy in all parts of the world at different career levels from both the public and the private sector. GWNET is an international non-profit organisation founded in 2017 under Austrian law. Download the GWNET Flyer Statutes GWNET is governed by statutes. Read the statutes here.

220329,greenclimate_220329_3_004,https://www.greenclimate.fund/about#overview,GreenClimate,"Overview There is a shrinking window of opportunity to address the climate crisis. Average global temperature is currently estimated to be 1.1°C above pre-industrial times. Based on existing trends, the world could cross the 1.5°C threshold within the next two decades and 2°C threshold early during the second half of the century. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is still narrowly possible and will be determined by the investment decisions we make over the next decade. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) – a critical element of the historic Paris Agreement - is the world’s largest climate fund, mandated to support developing countries raise and realize their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) ambitions towards low-emissions, climate-resilient pathways. Our transformative approach We achieve our goal by investing across four transitions – built environment; energy & industry; human security, livelihoods and wellbeing; and land-use, forests and ecosystems – and employing a four-pronged approach: Transformational planning and programming: by promoting integrated strategies, planning and policymaking to maximise the co-benefits between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development. Catalysing climate innovation: by investing in new technologies, business models, and practices to establish a proof of concept. De-risking investment to mobilize finance at scale: by using scarce public resources to improve the risk-reward profile of low emission climate resilient investment and crowd-in private finance, notably for adaptation, nature-based solutions, least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). Mainstreaming climate risks and opportunities into investment decision-making to align finance with sustainable development: by promoting methodologies, standards and practices that foster new norms and values. Climate change offers businesses an unprecedented chance to capitalise on new growth and investment opportunities that can protect the planet as well. GCF employs part of its funds to help mobilise financial flows from the private sector to compelling and profitable climate-smart investment opportunities.",Overview

Um excelente exemplo é a capacidade natural das florestas de atuarem como filtros e reduzirem significativamente os custos com o tratamento de água. O conceito de SbN está pautado e se relaciona intrinsicamente com os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS) da ONU. Embora o conceito seja bastante amplo, o foco de atuação da Fundação no tema prioriza ações relacionadas ao aumento da infraestrutura natural para água. Neste sentido, atua diretamente nas agendas estratégicas de Água, Clima e Pagamentos por Serviços Ambientais. Confira aqui todos os estudos que já publicamos sobre este assunto. Rede Oásis Solução baseada na natureza e no compartilhamento Exemplo de solução inovadora, a Rede Oásis, em seu programa de aceleração, trabalha para conectar atores estratégicos (sejam eles investidores, projetos ou instituições) que estejam comprometidos com a resolução de problemas atuais por meio de Soluções Baseadas na Natureza. Com a expertise adquirida em mais de 12 anos de atuação com a Oásis, a Fundação Grupo Boticário ajuda a compartilhar experiências com potencial para acelerar e fortalecer outras iniciativas. E faz isso promovendo a troca de experiências entre parceiros de setores e agendas variadas, os quais não se conectariam necessariamente de outra forma. Com um intuito muito claro: colaborar para a conservação da natureza. SAIBA MAIS Mudanças Climáticas Um desafio que exige compromisso Diversas atividades humanas emitem gases como CO2, CH4, e N2O, os principais gases do efeito estufa. Algumas atividades, como a queima de combustíveis fósseis e o desmatamento, intensificam o aquecimento global, provocando alterações no sistema climático do planeta. Isso significa que as estações do ano e períodos de chuva aos quais estamos acostumados ficam cada vez mais imprevisíveis e que espécies e ecossistemas naturais tornam-se ainda mais ameaçados. Diante desse cenário, diversos países, entre os quais o Brasil, comprometeram-se a agir contra a mudança global do clima, com o objetivo de conter o aumento da temperatura média global. Desse compromisso nasceu o Acordo de Paris, assinado em 2015, durante a 21ª Conferência das Partes da Convenção- -Quadro das Nações Unidas sobre Mudança de Clima (COP21). Gerando conhecimento científico e caminhos para influenciar em políticas públicas e privadas, a Fundação Grupo Boticário direciona esforços para que a conservação da natureza seja considerada nas estratégias de mitigação (redução das emissões de GEE), públicas e privadas. Adaptação baseadaem Ecossistemas Utilizar os serviços ecossistêmicos e de biodiversidade como parte de uma estratégia de adaptação das pessoas e comunidades aos efeitos negativos das mudanças climáticas, Este é o conceito de Adaptação baseada em Ecossistemas (AbE). Os ambientes naturais bem conservados aumentam a nossa resiliência aos efeitos negativos das alterações no clima. Além disso, as áreas naturais protegidas são estratégicas, pois o carbono capturado da atmosfera pela vegetação fica armazenado tanto na biomassa (plantas e animais) como no solo.

For more than 50 years, we have supported efforts to advance education for all, preserve the environment, support vibrant performing arts, strengthen Bay Area communities, make the philanthropy sector more effective, and foster gender equity and responsive governance around the world. The foundation was established in 1966 by engineer and entrepreneur William R. Hewlett and his wife, Flora Lamson Hewlett, with their eldest son, Walter Hewlett. Today, it is one of the largest philanthropic institutions in the United States, awarding over $465 million in grants in 2020 to organizations across the globe to help people build better lives. Our philanthropic approach, and our core areas of grantmaking, remain connected to the ethos and values of our founders. Established through the personal generosity of the Hewlett family, the foundation is wholly independent of the Hewlett Packard Company and the Hewlett Packard Company Foundation. Our Programs We have long-standing programs that focus on education, environment, gender equity and governance, performing arts, and effective philanthropy, as well as support for disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, we make grants for special projects and address other timely problems, such as challenges related to cybersecurity and U.S. democracy. Our Grants We make grants to a broad range of institutions—from research universities contributing to public knowledge and performing arts centers engaging local diverse communities, to grassroots organizations representing millions of individuals and multilateral groups working on international development. At any one time, more than 2,250 of our grants are active. In 2020, the foundation awarded $465,869,000 in grants and disbursed $471,308,000 in grant payments. As of December 31, 2020, the foundation’s assets were approximately $13.3 billion. View our financial statements and public disclosures, as well as grantmaking FAQ. Our People The Hewlett Foundation depends on a cooperative working relationship between our president, board and staff. Our board of directors always includes four members of the Hewlett family and between five and 11 other leaders drawn from philanthropy, government, business, education and civil society. Our president, Larry Kramer, is a constitutional law scholar and the former dean of Stanford Law School. We have approximately 120 employees, all located in the Bay Area, working together to advance the foundation’s mission and support our grantees. View our demographics and open positions.",About Us

220329,hewlettfoundation_220329_3_002,https://hewlett.org/about-us/values-and-policies/,hewlettfoundation,"Our philanthropic approach flows directly from the ethos and values of our founders. We are committed to acting honestly and with integrity, in accordance with the law and the highest standards of practice, and to treating all those with whom we deal fairly and respectfully. Undertaking to act ethically, however, is only part of what we must do to fulfill the aims of our founders, which include their desire that we use the foundation’s resources effectively for the betterment of society. Philanthropy is a distinctive enterprise, with unique challenges and opportunities. The Hewletts approached it with a humanistic philosophy based on faith in the capacity of people to do good and belief in the importance of healthy institutions as a means for doing so. Accordingly, we pursue our charitable goals through adherence to the following additional commitments and guiding principles: We seek to bring about meaningful, socially beneficial change in the fields in which we work. We pursue change by tackling defined problems in a pragmatic, nonpartisan manner. We focus on outcomes in order to maximize the effectiveness of our support. We are committed to openness, transparency, and learning. We are committed to working, both internally and externally, in a collaborative fashion based on mutual respect. Grantees, co-funders, and other colleagues in our work are our partners in problem-solving. We seek to promote the values and practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion in our workforce, our culture, and our grantmaking. We approach our role in philanthropy and our responsibilities to society with humility and respect for others. Our operations depend on a lean staff, which is given considerable autonomy; a commitment to simple, flexible procedures; and a cooperative working relationship between the board, staff, and the president, who is the leader of the foundation. Read more about our board’s guiding principles here.",Our Guiding Principles
220329,hewlettfoundation_220329_3_003,https://hewlett.org/about-us/our-programs/,hewlettfoundation,"The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation began in 1966 with the broad purpose of promoting the wellbeing of humanity. Many of our programs—from arts and education to women’s health and the environment—have been in place for decades. Our grantmaking also addresses other current and timely problems, such as challenges posed in U.S. democracy, cybersecurity, and wealth inequality. To understand what we fund and why, learn more about our programs and initiatives. Our Education Program makes grants to help educators, schools, and communities turn schools into places that empower and equip every student for a lifetime of learning, and to expand access to open educational resources. Our Environment Program makes grants to protect people and places threatened by a warming planet by conserving the North American West, expanding clean energy, and addressing climate change globally. Our Gender Equity and Governance Program seeks to foster inclusive societies by expanding women’s reproductive and economic choices, increasing governments’ responsiveness to the people they serve, and improving policymaking through the effective use of evidence. Our Performing Arts Program makes grants to support meaningful artistic experiences for communities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Our U.S. Democracy Program makes grants to strengthen America’s electoral and governing institutions and, in doing so, build public trust in our democracy. Our Effective Philanthropy Program seeks to strengthen the capacity of Hewlett Foundation grantees and philanthropy in general, to achieve their goals and benefit the common good. Our Cyber Initiative seeks to cultivate a field that develops thoughtful, multidisciplinary solutions to complex cyber challenges and catalyzes better policy outcomes for the benefit of societies. Our Economy and Society Initiative seeks to replace neoliberalism with a new “common sense” about how the economy works and the aims it should serve to improve the lives of people. The foundation started in the San Francisco Bay Area and maintains a deep commitment to the region by making grants that seeks to improve the lives of diverse communities. In addition, funding is reserved each year to support special projects that do not necessarily align with our primary programs. In 2020, the foundation announced a $150 million grantmaking commitment to racial justice. Past Programs Over the decades, the foundation has worked on pressing issues that diverged from our core focus. Our past programs—children and youth, conflict resolution, family and community development, and U.S.-Latin American relations—have made significant contributions toward their fields, but no longer make grants today.",Our Programs
220329,hewlettfoundation_220329_3_004,https://hewlett.org/about-us/our-policies/,hewlettfoundation,"Conflict of interest policy William and Flora Hewlett established the foundation exclusively to advance charitable purposes for the public good. The board honors the founders’ values by requiring the highest ethical standards of the directors, advisors, and staff; by using the foundation’s assets efficiently for the foundation’s philanthropic objectives; and by taking measures to assure that decisions are not influenced by self-interest. The conflict of interest policy is intended to provide guidance on how to deal appropriately with situations that involve, or may appear to involve, conflicts of interest, and to comply with federal and state laws concerning conflicts of interest. View the full policy: Conflict of Interest Policy [PDF] Equal employment opportunity and policy against harassment Consistent with our Guiding Principles, the foundation is firmly committed to diversity in staffing and the maintenance of an environment free of discrimination. We provide opportunities to all employees based on merit, qualifications, and job requirements. The foundation is committed to a policy of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity in all aspects of employment to all persons without regard to gender, pregnancy, age, color, race, national origin, ancestry, marital status, religion, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, medical condition, veteran status, or any other legally protected category. This policy governs all aspects of employment at the foundation, including hiring, assignments, training, promotions, compensation, employee benefits, discipline, and discharge. Also consistent with our values and the law, the foundation is committed to providing and maintaining a workplace that is free of sexual harassment and any form of harassment based upon a legally protected characteristic. The foundation absolutely will not tolerate unlawful harassment against our employees, applicants or contractors by any employee or other third party. View the full policy: Equal Employment Opportunity Policies (PDF) Commitment to open licensing As part of our commitment to openness and transparency, the Hewlett Foundation has long supported open licensing—a replacement for traditional copyright that encourages sharing intellectual property. Open licenses, such as those developed by our longtime grantee Creative Commons, protect authors’ rights while explicitly permitting others to freely use, distribute, and build upon their work. The benefits are substantial: open licensing increases the chances that good ideas get a hearing, that others develop them further, and, ultimately, that they have their greatest impact. The Hewlett Foundation makes information related to our grantmaking available under an open license so that others may learn from our experience. In 2014, we extended this commitment to open licensing to include, in appropriate circumstances, materials created with our grant dollars. More specifically, the Hewlett Foundation now requires that grantees receiving project-based grants—those made for a specific purpose—openly license the final materials created with those grants (reports, videos, white papers, and the like) under the most recent Creative Commons Attribution license. We also will require that the materials be made easily accessible to the public, such as by posting them to a grantee’s website. These requirements will not apply to grants made for general operating support of an organization or a program or center within an organization because they are incompatible with the nature of general support. We very much hope however, that the positive experience of openly licensing materials created with project-based grants will encourage grantees to do so for all their work. The Attribution license is the most open license offered by Creative Commons. It gives others permission, free of charge and in advance, to acquire and make licensed work available, and even to incorporate it into new work—to “remix, transform and build upon” the work, in Creative Commons’ phrase. This includes a right to sell the licensed work, so long as the original author is credited for his or her contribution. We will not enforce this new requirement thoughtlessly. If our default open license does not make sense for a particular project—such as if the work contains sensitive information or if revenue generated by its sale is critical to an organization’s financial well-being—we will work with the grantee to determine the most appropriate license. Our commitment to open licensing is meant to help, not harm, grantees, and we will administer it accordingly. We believe that open licensing of the Hewlett Foundation’s own work and of work created with funding from us will make our grant dollars go further and so increase our ability to contribute to the common good. It allows others more easily to find, use, respond to, and build upon ideas that can help people build better lives. Social investment policy The Hewlett Foundation’s broad purpose is to promote the well-being of humanity. Alternatively stated, our objective is to generate maximum social benefit from our financial and human resources. The Board believes that the Foundation creates substantial social benefit through its grants and related philanthropic activities. View our social investment policy: Social Investment Policy [PDF] Policy on indirect costs for project or program grants The Hewlett Foundation is committed to working with grantees in a collaborative fashion—treating them as partners and seeking to facilitate rather than dictate what they do. As part of that commitment, we provide long-term, general operating support whenever possible and fund grantees’ true costs when making restricted project or program grants. Our policy on indirect costs is intended to provide greater clarity for organizations submitting proposal applications and budgets for project or program grants. The Hewlett Foundation does not employ a fixed minimum or maximum rate for indirect costs. When proposals require grantees to submit budgets with indirect costs estimates, we want the proposals to reflect the prospective grantees’ actual indirect costs for the project or program in question. Grant budgets that do not fully cover the indirect costs needed to support a grantee’s work—whether submitted because the grantee does not know the true costs, or because of an assumption that funders won’t pay them—give rise to what has been aptly named the non-profit starvation cycle. That cycle is aggravated when funders accept these unrealistically low estimates at face value, refuse to pay indirect costs, or impose arbitrary caps on what costs can be recovered. We want to avoid this pernicious cycle with our grantees. We recognize that every grant has a unique purpose and structure and that costs vary depending on many factors. We set each grant’s total amount in the context of our overall grantmaking budget and funding priorities, and through a consultative process with the grantee. As part of that process, we intend for grantees to take the lead in determining how best to allocate those grant dollars to direct and indirect costs. In our policy, we provide guidance for specific types of organizations and special cases, but we encourage grantees and potential grantees who have questions to consult with their Program Officer at any time. View the full policy: Policy on Indirect Costs for Project or Program Grants (PDF) I View in Spanish, French Make a Whistleblower Report Submit an anonymous report with EthicsPoint Whistleblower Policy: Reporting concerns, complaints, or violations and protection for whistleblowers The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation expects its directors, officers, and employees to act honestly and with integrity, in accordance with high ethical standards, and to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and foundation policies in the conduct of their duties. The foundation is committed to facilitating open and honest communications in all matters pertaining to its governance, finances, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, and encourages the reporting of good faith concerns, complaints, and violations. Any director, officer, or employee who violates or suspects any violation of the law, regulations, foundation policies, or accounting, auditing, and financial reporting controls must report such activity as soon as possible by submitting a report under this policy. It is important that the foundation be apprised about unlawful or improper behavior including, but not limited to, any of the following conduct: theft; financial reporting that is intentionally misleading; improper or undocumented financial transactions; destroying or tampering with any record or document with the intent to obstruct a pending or contemplated audit, review or investigation; improper use of foundation assets; corruption or bribery; insider trading; payment for services or goods that are not rendered or delivered; violations of the foundation’s Conflict of Interest Policy; and any other improper occurrence regarding cash, financial procedures, or financial reporting; other illegal activities.

220329,ifoam_220329_3_000,https://www.ifoam.bio/our-work/where/latin-america,ifoam,"Latin America is a region characterized by its abundance of biodiversity. As the cradle of civilization, the region's agrobiodiversity and biocultural resources make it one of the most important regions in the global organic movement. A lot of land here is managed organically and there is great diversity in production. In addition, there are a lot of farmers in Latin America who supply local, regional and global markets. The region is also home to a number of productive and socio-economic innovations that have been successfully replicated and extended to all continents. Organic Agriculture in the region takes its full expression in Agroecology, which adheres to the Principles of Organic Agriculture. From Latin America and the Caribbean, contributions have emerged for a better inclusion of family agriculture in the sector's policies, the social construction of agro-ecological markets and the development of scientific and technological solutions for climate change. IFOAM - Organics International has a regional office based in Lima, Peru. Since 2007, the regional office has been building bridges among members, allies and the broader network of the regional organic and agroecological movement. Regional initiatives such as IFOAM Regional Group (SoS), PGS Latinamerican Forum, INOFO-LA, are among the main parties initiatives supporting efforts to build dialogue, bring cooperation, and strengthen learning exchanges. Capacity development and training programs also run in Latin America. To date there have been two Organic Leadership Courses (Liderazgo en Producción Orgánica y Agroecología), one in Mexico and one in Brazil; and we expect to run soon a third edition!",Latin America
220329,ifoam_220329_3_001,https://www.ifoam.bio/why-organic,ifoam,"Organic agriculture can be a pathway to addressing not only hunger and malnutrition but also other challenges including poverty, water use, climate change, and unsustainable production and consumption. We are in a crisis in many ways More than 800 million people go hungry and about 2 billion are malnourished. About 30 percent of the global adult population is overweight or obese, and around 30 percent of food produced worldwide is lost or wasted. Nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history. Up to 1 million species are threatened with extinction, many within decades. Land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23% of the global land surface, up to US$577 billion in annual global crops are at risk from pollinator loss. According to an FAO report on the state of biodiversity, of the thousands of plant species cultivated for food, fewer than 200 contribute substantially to global food output and only nine account for 66% of total crop production. Unsustainable Agriculture is Part of the Problem Unsustainable agriculture is the largest driver of biodiversity loss, it is contributing to global warming, contaminating soil, threatening rural livelihoods as well as food & nutrition security. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed that our food systems are estimated to cause up to 29% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Chemical fertilizers used to grow food are responsible for the majority of nitrous oxide released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity. There are estimates that agriculture is directly responsible for 80% of deforestation worldwide. Farmers often bear the consequences of our unsustainable economies and lifestyles. They are some of the world's poorest and most food insecure people, most severely hit by climate change. We need systemic change The negative impacts of input-intensive or industrial agriculture on the environment and health, its inefficacy to provide a decent income for farmers, its high reliance on fossil fuels and high vulnerability to climate change all show the need for change. Many of our policies only exacerbate the issues. According to a recent analysis, only 1% of the $700bn a year given to farmers is used to benefit the environment. It should be evident to us all that nourishing the world sustainably requires that we protect the ecological resources essential for producing food now and in the future. Organic Agriculture Offers a Solution The good news is that agriculture can also bring us solutions. About 30% of global crop production and global food supply is provided by small land holdings, less than 2 hectares, using around 25% of agricultural land, and in a way that usually maintains rich agrobiodiversity. Done right, agriculture based on the Principles of Organic Agriculture can be a transition pathway to the solutions needed for sustainable food systems and climate resilience. Organic agriculture is an accessible, affordable and empowering system for most smallholders given that its largely based on the use of local biodiversity and resources and incurs little external costs – particularly important for cash poor subsistence farmers. Farming for the Future The major problems of our time — energy, the environment, climate change, food security, financial security — cannot be understood in isolation. We need to create policies for food and agriculture taking all common concerns of humankind into consideration. Such policies and policy tools conducive to sustainable farming are crucial for supporting organic farmers, who are contributing to the common good and producing good food for all. Changing food systems also means changing conditions for farmers and food workers by placing greater emphasis on equity, social justice, and inclusivity. Changing our diets, for example, eating less meat, and choosing locally grown, seasonal, organic produce plays an important role as well.",Why Organic?

220329,insuresilience_220329_3_001,https://www.insuresilience-solutions-fund.org/about/about-isf,insuresilience,"Natural disasters are a major impediment to development in many countries, undermining sustainable development, threatening earlier achievements in poverty alleviation and leading to loss of lives and livelihoods. With climate change extreme weather events such as floods, storms and droughts are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. Aid often comes too little, too late – around one to six months after the disaster has struck - increasing the impacts of natural disasters by twofold and more. As an essential element of comprehensive risk management, climate risk insurance can mitigate the negative consequences providing reliable and fast financial support in the aftermath of extreme weather events. The mission of the InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF) is to support innovative solutions to mitigate these negative impacts of climate change. Therefore ISF fosters the development of needs-based and financially sustainable climate risk insurance products in developing and emerging countries, increasing the resilience of poor and vulnerable households against extreme weather events and natural catastrophes. As implementing programme of the InsuResilience Global Partnership the ISF is an important contribution of the German Government funded by KfW Development Bank to achieve the target of the international initiative on climate risk insurance ’InsuResilience’. The ISF also represents an implementation vehicle for the Tripartite Agreement, for this purpose the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been established. For more information visit Frankfurt School’s website. The ISF seeks to increase the capacity of developing countries to adapt to climate change through the introduction and use of climate risk insurance products by supporting comprehensive climate risk analysis as a vital basis for governments, businesses and households to become more proactive risk managers and take informed decisions in defining needs-based climate risk management and adaptation strategies. identifying possible concepts and basic structures of climate risk transfers via insurance solutions as an integral element of a comprehensive climate risk management strategy by funding studies on wider adaptation needs based on climate risk analysis. supporting the introduction and offer of innovative climate risk insurance products by co-funding the development of concrete insurance products.",Mission & Vision

220329,internationalclimateinitiative_220329_3_001,https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/en/about-iki/iki-funding-instrument,internationalclimateinitiative,"The International Climate Initiative (IKI) is the most important instrument utilised by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) to support international climate action and biodiversity. With the IKI, the BMU supports solution strategies in developing and emerging countries that seek to achieve sustainable change. Support is targeted precisely to the areas where needs and aspirations are the highest. IKI assists its partner countries to implement the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that lie at the heart of the Paris Agreement and to take an ambitious approach to their future development. Such development includes measures for adaptation to the impacts of climate change and for improving resilience to the unavoidable consequences. In relation to biodiversity, IKI supports partner countries in their efforts to achieve the targets agreed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) with the aim of countering and reversing the dramatic losses suffered by natural habitats all over the planet. To obtain IKI funding, proposed projects must be based in countries on a list prepared by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). To date, IKI has approved funding for more than 750 climate and biodiversity projects in over 60 countries worldwide, with a total funding volume of 4.5 billion euros (2008–2020).The IKI finances projects run by organisations that implement measures together with developing, emerging and transitional countries within the four IKI funding areas:Mitigating greenhouse gas emissionsAdapting to the impacts of climate changeConserving natural carbon sinks with a focus on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+)Conserving biological diversity Many projects normally involve more than one funding area. The list of measures addressed by IKI projects includes advising policymakers, capacity building, technology partnerships and innovative financing mechanisms. Funding is also available for reports and position papers as well as investment vehicles for climate action and biodiversity conservation.Topic-driven financing and bilateral cooperationThe IKI uses a two-pronged strategy to support its partner countries. On the one hand, this involves ideas competitions with a thematic focus: these include large-volume thematic selection procedures (thematic calls) as well as two small-scale project programmes, namely IKI Small Grants and IKI Medium Grants. All three types of ideas competition utilise a call-for-proposals model for funding priorities that are set each year with no focus on individual countries. Based on their expertise and experience, implementing organisations propose project activities in countries that are a good match for the funding priorities.On the other hand, the IKI also works bilaterally in key areas with 15 priority countries. Part of this cooperation involves the country-specific, large-volume selection procedures (country calls). Working in close consultation with the partner governments, ideas competition is again used here to select projects for two specific and urgent thematic fields. In addition, a country-specific IKI ‘interface project’ also operates in most of these priority countries, working on key topics such as climate change mitigation, adaptation or biodiversity conservation. These interface projects are managed by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). The projects maintain an office in the respective priority country, work closely with German embassies and help to improve Germany’s cooperation with the partner country in the field of policymaking. Each interface project also facilitates networking of all the local IKI projects in the country run by different implementing organisations in order to maximise synergistic benefits between projects. The current 15 priority countries that the IKI works with are: Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Viet Nam.With the exception of IKI Small Grants, ideas competitions are organised into two stages. A shortlist of projects is compiled from all the project outlines submitted. The shortlisted applicants are requested to prepare a detailed project proposal. This proposal is then used as the basis for the final funding decision. Two key features of IKI set it apart from conventional approaches to development cooperation. One is the competitive model for the funding programme and the other is the inclusion of NGOs as implementing organisations. None of IKI funds flow to government institutions in partner countries. Topic-related advice and assistance, programme management and project evaluation work are supported by the IKI Secretariat, which forms part of the federally owned Zukunft – Umwelt – Gesellschaft (ZUG) gGmbH.",IKI funding instrument

B. Leakey was one of the 20th century’s great anthropologists and a tireless promoter of science education and public outreach. During Dr. Leakey’s travels to the United States in the 1960s to lecture and raise money for his research, he met a group of enthusiastic individuals who were curious about human origins and evolution. Inspired by Dr. Leakey and his ideas, they started a collective to promote a multidisciplinary approach to human origins research. In 1968, they formed The Leakey Foundation to support Louis and Mary Leakey’s fieldwork and the groundbreaking research of young scientists such as Jane Goodall, Don Johanson, Dian Fossey, and Birute Galdikas.In its first decade of existence, The Leakey Foundation provided funding many of the seminal studies that inform our understanding of human prehistory. Today The Leakey Foundation continues to support the significant studies of researchers such as Zeresenay Alemseged, Jill Pruetz, Dan Lieberman, Frederick Grine, Sileshi Semaw, and many more.

220329,leakeyfoundation_220329_3_002,https://leakeyfoundation.org/about/the-leakey-family/,leakeyfoundation,"Louis Seymour Bazett LeakeyLouis Leakey in Kenya in 1955.Louis Leakey (b. 1903, d. 1972) was a tireless promoter of the study of human origins. With his theoretical and paleontological work in the field, he had a considerable impact on the science of early human evolution.In addition to the 20 books and over 150 articles he wrote in his lifetime as well as the multiple fossil and stone tool discoveries that contributed so significantly to our understanding of the field, he was also largely responsible for convincing other scientists that Africa was the key location in which to search for evidence of human origins. In the face of great opposition, he strongly supported Darwin’s assertion that human evolution began in Africa. As it turns out, Leakey’s early, controversial, yet unwavering position that Africa was the cradle of humanity has held up against modern scientific scrutiny and is now universally accepted.Louis was born on August 7, 1903, at Kabete Mission (near Nairobi) in Kenya, where his parents Harry and Mary (Bazett) Leakey were English missionaries to the Kikuyu tribe. Louis grew up speaking Kikuyu as fluently as English, and at age thirteen he was initiated as a member of the Kikuyu tribe. He later wrote a definitive study of their culture in 1937.Leakey began his university career at Cambridge University in 1922, but a rugby injury caused him to postpone his studies. He then left to help manage a paleontological expedition to Africa. He graduated with degrees in both anthropology and archaeology in 1926. After completing his degrees, Leakey began leading expeditions to Olduvai, a river gorge in Tanzania, where he found important fossils and Stone Age tools. In 1948 he reported finding a 20-million-year-old skull he named Proconsul africanus on Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, Kenya. Though now considered to be too specialized to have been a direct ancestor of current ape and human populations, Proconsul is still deemed scientifically valuable as a model for early human ancestors.Louis and Mary Leakey with the jaw of Zinjanthropus, now known as Paranthopus boisei. Photo by Des Bartlett from The Leakey Foundation archive.The first significant hominid fossil attributed to Leakey, a robust skull with huge teeth dated to 1.75 million years ago, was found by Louis’ collaborator and second wife Mary Leakey. She found it in deposits that also contained stone tools. Louis claimed it was a human ancestor and called it Zinjanthropus boisei. It is now understood to be a form of Australopithecus. Another important discovery was the 1964 reporting of Homo habilis (named by Louis, Phillip Tobias and John Napier), which Leakey believed was the first member of the actual human genus as well as the first true toolmaker. Though the interpretations of Leakey’s fossil finds were and still are controversial, their significance to the field of human origins is generally acknowledged.Leakey had a significant effect on not only the field of paleoanthropology but also primatology. He was responsible for initiating Jane Goodall’s long-term field study of chimpanzees in the wild, and he helped obtain and coordinate funding for similar projects such as Dian Fossey’s work with mountain gorillas in Rwanda and Birute Galdikas’ work with orangutans in the Sarawak region of Indonesia.Always a dynamic and energetic man, Leakey kept up a rigorous schedule of lecturing and fundraising. In 1972, while on route to a speaking engagement in London, Louis Leakey suffered a heart attack and died.Louis Leakey radically changed the way we now view early humans. Though he always had his detractors, Louis Leakey is considered to be a significant contributor to the understanding of our origins. He pushed back the known dates for the existence of various species, changed phylogenies to include the existence of parallel lines of evolution in the human family, stimulated research in new fields like primatology, and generated interest and publicity for the study of human origins.",The Leakey Family
220329,lighthousefoundation_220329_3_000,https://lighthouse-foundation.org/en/The-Motivation.html,lighthousefoundation,"The MotivationThe oceans - basis of the global systemEarth's oceans are what give our planet its identity - the blue planet, the watery globe. They are the cradle of life, the region with the highest level of biodiversity we know, an irreplaceable source of food, a source and a storage chamber in world-scale chemical and energy cycles, the engine of earth's climate. The oceans determine the nature and quality of the biosphere far beyond their coastlines. They are the sustaining, all-encompassing element in the global biosphere. Human awareness of the oceansThe true global and local significance of the seas and oceans of our world is by no means reflected in our actual level of awareness of them. After many thousands of years of coastal and maritime human activity we are only just beginning to understand the depths and secrets of our watery planet. And the further we progress, the more clearly we are coming to recognize the extent of human influence on natural processes in the seas and oceans¾we are beginning to see what we have changed. Focus on the coastal regionsHuman activity is concentrating increasingly in the coastal regions, which already harbour 60% of world's population. Oceanic shelves and the coastline itself are highly attractive areas for marine, amphibian and terrestrial life forms and are the venues for intensive exchange processes with the oceans. The transition area between sea and land will therefore increasingly be a focus of future economic, social and ecological conflicts. Coastal regions are therefore predestined locations for the development and implementation of environmentally compatible concepts of a long-term nature. Need for clear-cut, decisive approachesThe need for action oriented at its very inception towards the longer term and a holistic picture of the earth and the consequences of our presence on it has now gained general world-wide recognition. The peoples of the world adopted the goal of sustainable development at the Rio Conference of 1992.Since then, discussion on implementation of these goals has gone on at various levels. Everybody realizes that holistic approaches are needed and should be implemented, but the activities that actually see the light of day so often follow a cleanup or follow-up scheme that is hardly suitable for realizing concrete objectives. There is still a need for quality interdisciplinary approaches. The public and its decision-makers and opinion leaders must also open their eyes to exemplary positive developments. These are the declared tasks of the Lighthouse FoundationAddresses:Lighthouse FoundationMönckebergstr. 22D-20 095 Hamburg, Germany Lighthouse Foundation, Office KielKanalstraße 67aD-24 159 Kiel, GermanyTel: +49 (0)431 668 468 0Fax: +49 (0)431 668 468 11",The Motivation
220329,lighthousefoundation_220329_3_001,https://lighthouse-foundation.org/en/Cooperation.html,lighthousefoundation,"Orientation:Criteria for co-operation with the FoundationThe Lighthouse Foundation (LF) evaluates applications for assistance according to various criteria. The LF reserves the right to apply specific criteria individually and flexibly to particular cases in evaluating the applications for assistance. The terms ""sustainability"" and ""sustainable development"" are applied as defined in Agenda 21.There is no such thing as a legal right to eligibility for Foundation assistance.Maritime themeIn accordance with the orientation of the LF, projects and measures must have a maritime theme and be suitable as models for follow-up projects and measures in other regions of the world. They must be of such a nature as to make people in other regions receptive to the theme and make a concrete contribution to an enhanced awareness of the maritime world. Receptivity for and an awareness ofsustainable development should not be narrowed down to sustained utilization of maritime resources. The important thing is to make it clear that the natural world in its biological and physical phenomenology is of value per se and cannot be reduced to the isolated aspect of satisfaction of human needs. The usefulness and visibility factorof a project or measure are closely related in the view of the LF. A high profile and widespread dissemination of information on activities generate the kind of positive attention and curiosity maritime themes and problems deserve. What we need to evaluate a project or measure is a clear-cut description of the contribution it will make. Coastal regions are the target regionsfor measures and projects geared to sustained development in the maritime field. The ecological land/sea boundary is at the same time the human/sea interface and thus the focal point of the relevant ecological, economic and social challenges. Interdisciplinary and inter-sector activitiesconstitute the most promising approaches for initiation of sustained development processes in the maritime field. The concerns of regional populations must be a central focus and local personalities should be engaged as driving forces behind the activities. Methods of project realizationBoth the methods and organization employed by institutions and persons responsible for the projects or measures must reflect the principle of sustainability. Regional developmental impulsesProjects and measures aiming at co-operation on regional development must generate clearly defined and recognizable developmental impulses within a patently regional framework. The objective must be to improve the living conditions of the regional population in a sustainable manner and to contribute directly to a palpable reduction of resource consumption. Exemplary functionProjects and measures geared solely to an individual situation with little relevance to wider circles can only be applied to other situations in other regions at considerable expense. The higher the exemplary profile of a project or measure, the greater its utility for the seas and oceans on a global scale. Synergistic effects Projects and measures that are to receive financial assistance from the LF must also take into account commitments from other donor organizations. Redundancies in donor work must be avoided, although by the same token the activities of other donors can certainly be integrated to create beneficial synergistic effects. Utilization of financial means The LF always considers financial aid in terms of the scope and focus of the resulting contribution to Foundation goals and to a solution of the essential problem as formulated in the project application.Addresses:Lighthouse FoundationMönckebergstr. 22D-20 095 Hamburg, Germany Lighthouse Foundation, Office KielKanalstraße 67aD-24 159 Kiel, GermanyTel: +49 (0)431 668 468 0Fax: +49 (0)431 668 468 11",Cooperation

Since its founding, that experience has informed LTC’s commitment to seeking bipartisan and economically sound approaches to addressing critical environmental challenges. At heart, we share the common values of wise stewardship of our natural resources and the efficacy of markets, incentives and innovation. We seek to identify practical, efficient, and non-partisan solutions that allow people to find common ground and move forward. Until 2014, our focus was primarily on environmental markets and biodiversity conservation. Since 2015, we have been almost entirely focused on U.S. climate policy. How We Work We provide both funding and substantial staff time and execution management for our projects. We generally take the initiative in designing the objective of each of our projects and in recruiting both the organizations and the additional funders needed to achieve that objective. Among other approaches, we support research, policy analysis and opinion polling. We work on and fund a very small number of projects at a time but are highly committed to driving measurable outcomes for each of them. Our Climate Policy Initiatives We seek to help U.S. policymakers develop comprehensive climate policy frameworks and strategies for implementing them. We are particularly focused on two important components of such frameworks: Carbon Dioxide Removal. We are seeking to gain policy support for carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere, an urgently-needed complement to emission reduction. Carbon Pricing. We seek the adoption of an economy-wide, market-based incentive to address climate change and advance a clean-energy economy.

Our objective: fighting against infectious diseases on the ground in developing countries and improving living conditions for mothers and children. We focus on four priorities Increasing vulnerable populations’ access to diagnostics We are committed to improving the access to diagnostics in developing countries because a rapid and reliable diagnosis and high-quality monitoring are essential steps in patient care. Yet, diagnostics remain the weak link in health systems in developing countries. By strengthening clinical laboratories in national healthcare systems, we aim to increase vulnerable populations’ access to diagnostics. We strengthen the clinical laboratory sector in national health systems through a comprehensive approach: we renovate and equip facilities, we provide technical training, we implement new tests and quality, biosecurity and biosafety standards, taking into account laboratory management, cost recovery systems and building networks among the labs. We always work in partnership with the health authorities to harmonize approaches and to share resources and expertise across regions, countries or sub-regions. We strengthen the practice of clinical diagnostics and train personnel, both in capital cities and in the surrounding regions as part of a long-term engagement. Our goal is to build the capacities of our local partners to offer quality services to the population, for surveillance and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. Enhancing local applied research capabilities To fight the diseases that affect developing countries, we aim to build and increase the quality of applied research capabilities. We train scientists, develop collaborative applied research programs to address local infectious disease challenges. Our research focuses on four main disease areas: respiratory infections, foodborne (enteric) diseases, emerging diseases, and antimicrobial resistance. We also build laboratories of excellence in regions prone to infectious disease outbreaks in developing countries: the Rodolphe Mérieux Laboratories. They meet the most exacting international standards and are transferred to local partners. Encouraging knowledge-sharing and public health initiatives Dr. Charles Mérieux strived to make medical and scientific innovation accessible to the greatest number of people. We uphold that tradition and organize high-level scientific symposia and conferences, which disseminate medical advances internationally. We also offer courses for public health decision-makers from developing countries to strengthen their skills and expertise. We do this through Les Pensières Center for Global Health, our conference center located near Annecy, less than an hour from Geneva, which offers a unique environment for work and discussion. In parallel, we support global innovative public health initiatives. These collaborations between international public and private stakeholders can make us more responsive and effective in the midst of a health crisis. Improving conditions for mothers and children Epidemic risks have never been higher in a world affected by wars and climate change, which favor the spread of infectious disease. We cannot, however, address public health challenges by looking uniquely at medical care, which remains central to our action. We believe that healthcare requires a global approach and must be adapted to realities in the field. Working with Fondation Christophe et Rodolphe Mérieux and local partners to provide housing, access to safe food and drinking water, better nutrition, education and employment, in addition to healthcare, we strive to sustainably improve the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable populations in low income settings: mothers and children.",What We Do

The MMPA set forth a national policy to prevent marine mammal species and population stocks from diminishing, as a result of human activities, beyond the point at which they cease to be significant functioning elements of the ecosystems of which they are a part. This year, we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the MMPA. We have accomplished a lot in the past 50 years, and the status of many marine mammal species has improved. While some species of large whales are finally recovering from centuries of whaling and many pinniped species also have successfully rebounded from overexploitation, many marine mammals still face direct and indirect impacts from fisheries, habitat loss, and other human activities. Great challenges lie ahead in the warming and rising seas of climate change and continued human dependence on the oceans, and we still have much work ahead of us to understand and manage threats to ensure that marine mammals have a bright future. We appreciate the work by our partners at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Fish and Wildlife Service and applaud their commitment to protecting marine mammals and helping their populations thrive. Please join our agencies this year as we celebrate 50 years of ocean and coastal conservation, acknowledging not just the 50th anniversary of the MMPA, but of three additional laws that helped form the foundation for the nation’s marine stewardship: the Clean Water Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. Visit our website to learn how you can get involved and help protect your ocean and coasts for the next 50 years to come. The Act Ecosystem-based management is an integrated management approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an ecosystem, including humans, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation. To learn more, visit ecosystems.noaa.gov. The MMPA was the first legislation to mandate an ecosystem-based approach to marine resource management. Under the MMPA, Congress directed that the primary objective of marine mammal management should be to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem and, when consistent with that primary objective, to obtain and maintain optimum sustainable populations of marine mammals. The ecosystem approach has been incorporated in other U.S. statutes including the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, in legislation in other countries, and in international agreements such as the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The MMPA includes a general moratorium on the taking and importing of marine mammals (Sec. 101 (a)), which is subject to a number of exemptions. The MMPA also established the Marine Mammal Commission (Sec. 201) and provides the authority under which the Commission operates. Learn more about the Commission’s duties under the MMPA.

Humanity treats it with contempt.”The Economist does not mince words. Human activity, on land and at sea, is driving an alarming decline in the health of the ocean. The ocean is changing—physically, chemically, biologically—as overfishing, pollution, climate change and the cumulative impacts of human activity take their toll. The human, economic and natural capital costs of our unfettered attitude to the seas are ever more evident.Into this stressed ocean a new wave of investment in the ‘blue economy’ is emerging, encouraged by ambitious national ocean strategies. The opportunities to guide development that respects or better still restores ocean health are enormous, as are the opportunities for creating jobs, income and growth. Yet so too are the risks, to the ocean and to our own well-being. A ‘blue’ economy implies some measure of alignment between economic development and the health of the ocean. Early signs are, in most countries, that the ‘blue economy’ typically prioritises growth over sustainability. Even where there is an explicit intention to align the two, the gap between these differing objectives is wide.The World Ocean Initiative will address this challenge. The past decade has seen a public awakening to the ocean. Turning this momentum into tangible gains, at scale, is the next step. We look forward to working with, and convening, policymakers, businesses and others who share a similar vision, expanding on the foundations of the World Ocean Summit to realise an ocean in robust health, and with a vital economy.Our activitiesThe World Ocean Initiative translates the momentum and focus of the World Ocean Summit into a year-round programme on the ocean that leverages the full capabilities of Economist Impact, combining the rigour of a think-tank with the creativity of a media brand to engage a globally influential audience. Through carefully designed and sequenced research and knowledge-building, by convening decision-makers across the ocean space and with the power of The Economist Group behind us, we aim to build new outcomes-focused agendas, and new constituencies, across our levers of change—blue finance, governance and innovation. The World Ocean Summit beats at the heart of the World Ocean Initiative, providing an annual stage to mark progress across our own initiative, and elsewhere across the cutting edge of the global ocean agenda.As thought leaders and conveners, we have a unique place in the wider ocean dialogue. The initiative combines activities from all parts of Economist Impact, including research, films and events, to inform, inspire and engage key stakeholders from across the ocean community.",About us
220329,oceanfdn_220329_3_000,https://oceanfdn.org/about/,oceanfdn,"[As the only community foundation for the ocean, The Ocean Foundation’s 501(c)(3) mission is to support, strengthen, and promote those organizations dedicated to reversing the trend of destruction of ocean environments around the world. We focus our collective expertise on emerging threats in order to generate cutting edge solutions and better strategies for implementation., Since the ocean covers 71% of the earth, our community is global. We have grantees, partners, and projects on all of the world’s continents, and we engage with donors and governments involved in ocean conservation anywhere in the world. The Ocean Foundation’s Board of Directors is comprised of individuals with significant experience in marine conservation philanthropy as well as esteemed professionals in ocean conservation. We also have a growing international advisory board of scientists, policy makers, educational specialists, and other top experts., The Ocean Foundation uses a well-established business model, the community foundation, to serve donors and partners who are passionate about the future of our coasts and ocean. This model enables The Ocean Foundation to increase the capacity of conservation organizations, host various projects and funds, and effectively connect regional and community-based non-profits with the support that they need. By raising millions of dollars each year from individuals, corporate donors, private foundations, and governments, we succeed in promoting healthy ocean ecosystems that benefit the human communities depending on them., We advance innovative and customized philanthropic solutions for donors. We simplify the giving process so that they can focus on their chosen passion for the coasts and ocean. We also evaluate marine conservation projects and determine the most effective organizations for our donors to support., Successful ocean conservation is a community effort. With the growing awareness that the work of individuals could be supported within a community problem-solving context, photographer and founder Wolcott Henry led a group of like-minded coral conservation experts, venture capitalists, and philanthropy colleagues in establishing the Coral Reef Foundation as the first community foundation for coral reefs, and thus the first coral reef conservation donors’ portal. Among its early projects was the first national poll about coral reef conservation in the United States, which was unveiled in 2002. , It quickly became clear that the founders needed to address the broader question of supporting donors interested in the conservation of broader ocean ecosystems, and do a re-imagining of how the well-known and accepted community foundation model could best serve the ocean conservation community. Thus, in 2003, The Ocean Foundation was launched with Wolcott Henry as founding Chair of the Board of Directors. Mark Spalding was brought in as President shortly thereafter. , The Ocean Foundation still operates using the known community foundation tools (pooled funds, advised funds, and fiscal sponsorship) and deploying them in an ocean context. From the beginning, The Ocean Foundation has been international, with well over two-thirds of its grants supporting causes outside the United States. We have hosted dozens of projects and worked collaboratively on every continent, on our one global ocean, and in most of the seven seas. , Applying our breadth and depth of knowledge about the global ocean conservation community to vet projects and reduce risk to donors, The Ocean Foundation has supported a diverse portfolio of projects that includes work on marine mammals, sharks, sea turtles and seagrass, as well as launched headline programs such as the International Ocean Acidification Initiative and the Blue Carbon Calculator. We’ve looked at the economic impact of debris on beaches and the ways communities can restore abundance to the fisheries on which they depend. We continue to seek out the opportunities to make all of us more effective and to make every dollar for ocean conservation stretch a little further. , The Ocean Foundation identifies trends, anticipates and responds to the growing needs and urgent issues related to ocean health and sustainability; and strives to strengthen the knowledge and expertise of the ocean conservation community as a whole. , Thus, we continue to identify both the solutions to the threats that face our ocean, and the organizations and individuals best suited to implement them. We work hard to ensure that we remain open to multiple strategies and new ideas about where and how those solutions could be developed and used. Our goal remains to achieve a level of global awareness that ensures we stop taking so much of the good stuff out and stop dumping bad stuff in recognition of the life-giving role of our global ocean., How can you help? If you recognize the value of investing resources in strategic ocean solutions or want a platform for your corporate community to participate in, we can work together on strategic ocean solutions.

Inherited jointly and freely, the ocean, coasts and marine ecosystems are held in trust for future generations., At The Ocean Foundation, we devote our time to supporting and enhancing the diverse and growing needs of the marine conservation community to effectively respond to the urgent issues threatening our ocean, and to capitalize on key conservation solutions in cost-effective, thoughtful ways. Our Research and Development for the 71% allows us to provide such valuable support services, capacity building and to otherwise meet the needs of those who depend on the coasts and ocean for their livelihoods, subsistence, and recreation. We use the concept of working for the 71% to take advantage of immediate conservation opportunities and work on longer-term solutions., , We conduct research and provide information to help the ocean-aware community of stakeholders identify best-in-class solutions to address the primary threats to the ocean. Then we integrate innovative science and technology with socio-economic, legal and political expertise to improve ocean governance and conservation around the world. At every opportunity, we strive to communicate the results of our R&D work in order to promote collaboration and information sharing across key ocean sectors and communities to increase replication of good ideas and avoid reinvention of the wheel., Who is leading this work?

220329,oceanfdn_220329_3_002,https://oceanfdn.org/grantmaking/,oceanfdn,"[For nearly twenty years now, we have strived to bridge the gap between philanthropy – which has historically given the ocean only 7% of environmental grantmaking, and ultimately, less than 1% of all philanthropy – with the communities that need this funding for marine science and conservation the most. However, the ocean covers 71% of the planet. That doesn’t add up. The Ocean Foundation (TOF) was founded to help change that calculus., , We practice philanthropy, to carefully transfer financial support from donors to our grantees, and to put boundaries of reason on our own personal conduct. Foundation officers are the guardians of our donors. As the gatekeepers, we are responsible to safeguard the donors against fraud, but also to act as real stewards of this ocean planet, its creatures, great and small, including humankind who depend on the coasts and ocean. This is not an airy or overly ambitious concept, but is a never-ending task from which we of philanthropy can neither abdicate nor shrink., We always remember the grantees are the ones doing the work on the water AND at the same time feeding their families and putting a roof over their head., We identify key threats to the coasts and ocean and apply a broad solutions oriented focus to address threats. This framework guides both our own initiatives and our external grantmaking. We support projects and organizations that advance the field of marine conservation and invest in individuals and organizations with a unique, promising ability to address those threats. To identify potential grantees, we use a combination of objective and subjective evaluation methods. We support multi-year giving whenever possible. Conserving the ocean is complicated and requires a long-term approach. We invest in individuals and organizations so that they can spend time on implementation, rather than on waiting for the next grant. , We practice “engaged, active philanthropy” to work with grantees as collaborative partners to improve effectiveness. We do not just give away money; we also serve as a resource, giving direction, focus, strategy, research and other advice and services as appropriate. We foster coalition building and individuals and organizations that pursue their unique work within context of existing and emerging coalitions. For example, as a signatory to the Climate Strong Islands Declaration, we seek to support projects and organizations that increase technical support available to island communities to develop new initiatives, programs, and projects that help them respond effectively to the growing climate crisis and other environmental challenges. We recognize the need to promote ocean conservation at the local and regional level in many other parts of the world, and thus, more than 50 percent of our grantmaking is to support projects outside the USA. We strongly support science diplomacy, as well as cross-cultural and international knowledge sharing, capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology., We strive to build and increase the capacity and effectiveness of the marine conservation community, in particular with those grantees who demonstrate a commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice in their proposals. We’re incorporating a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice lens into all facets of our conservation work to ensure our work promotes equitable practices, supports those who share similar values, and helps others embed those values in their work and we want to continue this practice through our philanthropy. , Our average grant size is approximately $10,000 and we encourage applicants to demonstrate a diverse funding portfolio if possible. , We do not support grants to religious organizations or for election campaigns. , The Ocean Foundation offers both direct grants from our own funds and we also provide grantmaking services for individual, corporate and government donors, or for outside organizations seeking institutional support capacity. , As an international community foundation, TOF raises every dollar it spends. Grantmaking funds may come from (1) general unrestricted donations, (2) funder collaboratives–a related type of pooled fund which has a more structured governance mechanism, and/or (3) Donor Advised Funds. , Letters of Inquiry are reviewed by our committee once per quarter. Applicants will be notified of any invitation to submit a full proposal via email. For each potential grantee, TOF undertakes detailed due diligence services, preliminary vetting, issues grant agreements, and administers all required grant reporting. , All of our grantmaking is inherently donor-driven, therefore we do not maintain a generic open request for proposals, and instead we only solicit proposals for which we already have an interested donor in mind. While many of the individual funds we host accept solicitations by invitation only, some of them do on occasion have open RFPs. Open RFPs will be publicized on our website and advertised throughout marine and conservation community email newsletters. , While we do not accept unsolicited funding requests, we understand that there are many organizations out there doing great work that might not be in the public eye. We always appreciate the opportunity to learn more about the people and projects working to conserve and protect our planet’s precious oceans. TOF accepts Letters of Inquiry on a rolling basis via email to [email protected]. Please do not call or mail hard copy Letters of Inquiry to the office. , Letters are kept on file for reference and are reviewed regularly as funds become available or as we interact with donors who have a specific interest in a topical area. We are always seeking new revenue streams and engaging in discussions with new potential donors. All inquiries will receive a response on whether funds are available. If we do come across a funding source that is a good fit for your project, we will contact you to possibly solicit a full proposal at that time. For budgeting reference, The Ocean Foundation’s policy is to limit indirect costs to no more than 15%., TOF houses a number of Donor Advised Funds, where an individual or group of donors play a role in selecting grantees aligned with their donor intent. In addition to working closely with the individual donors, TOF provides due diligence, vetting, grant agreements, and reporting services. , Please contact Jason Donofrio at [email protected] for more information., TOF’s institutional support capacity is for outside organizations who may be less able to process outgoing grants in a timely manner, or who may not have the staff expertise in-house. It allows us to provide detailed due diligence services, preliminary vetting of potential grantees and administer grant agreements and reporting., TOF also follows accessibility and best practice guidelines for our website and all Request for Proposals, grant application and reporting documentation. , For information on institutional support, capacity services or to submit a Letter of Inquiry, please email [email protected]. , As TOF expands its grantmaking to include support for organizations furthering Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) efforts, grants were awarded to Black In Marine Science and SurfearNEGRA., Black In Marine Science (BIMS) aims to celebrate Black marine scientists, spread environmental awareness, and inspire the next generation of scientific thought leaders. TOF’s $2,000 grant to BIMS will help to maintain the group’s YouTube channel, where it shares conversations on pressing ocean topics with Black scientists. The group provides honorariums to each individual that contributes a video., SurfearNEGRA strives to “diversify the lineup” of surfing girls. This organization will use its $2,500 grant to support its 100 Girls! Program, which provides funding for girls of color to attend surf camp in their local communities. This grant will help the group reach its goal of sending 100 girls to surf camp—that’s 100 more girls to understand both the thrill and peace of the ocean. This grant will support the participation of seven girls., For previous years’ grantees, click below:, The Ocean Foundation (TOF) awards grants in four categories: Conserving Marine Habitats and Special Places, Protecting Species of Concern, Building the Capacity of the Marine Conservation Community, and Expanding Ocean Literacy and Awareness. The funding for these grants originate from TOF’s Core Programs and Donor and Committee Advised Funds. In its fiscal year 2021, TOF awarded $628,162 to 41 organizations around the world., There are many outstanding conservation organizations dedicated to protecting and preserving our ocean. The Ocean Foundation provides assistance to these entities, which have a need to develop certain skills or competence, or for general upgrading of performance ability. The Ocean Foundation was created in part to bring new financial and technical resources to the table so that we can increase the capacity of these organizations to pursue their missions., Grogenics SB, Inc. | $35,000Grogenics will continue its sargassum insetting work by setting up a farmers hub in Miches, Dominican Republic to empower a group of 17 women to cultivate and sell crops with seaweed compost to sequester carbon and build living soils., Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust | $10,400Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust will conduct habitat restoration and conservation efforts in the Puerto Mosquito Bioluminescent Bay in Puerto Rico., The Harte Research Institute | $62,298The Harte Research Institute will work with Caribbean Marine Research and Conservation to develop and implement a broad sustainability-in-tourism management scheme for Cuba focused on recreational fishing policy., Caribbean Marine Research and Conservation | $34,952Caribbean Marine Research and Conservation will work with The Harte Research Institute to develop and implement a broad sustainability-in-tourism management scheme for Cuba focused on recreational fishing policy., The Harte Research Institute | $62,298The Harte Research Institute will work with Caribbean Marine Research and Conservation to develop and implement a broad sustainability-in-tourism management scheme for Cuba focused on recreational fishing policy., Sea Mammal Education Learning Tech Society (SMELTS) | $20,000SMELTS will conduct ropeless gear testing with lobster fishermen in New England and Atlantic Canada and cultivate relationships with U.S. and Canadian fishermen., 5 Gyres | $20,0005 Gyres will study the requirements for the complete biodegradation of PHA in varied environments and in different shapes and sizes followed by the launch of a multimedia communications strategy., Peak Plastic Foundation | $22,500Peak Plastic Foundation will build coalition and trust through storytelling and policy development, ensure its content reaches broad audiences, build a resource and action pipeline for upstream plastic battles, and share how NGOs can effectively work with communities suffering from plastic pollution., Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust | $10,000Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust will carry out habitat restoration and conservation efforts in the Puerto Mosquito Bioluminescent Bay., SECORE International | $30,000SECORE International will conduct community-based coastal remediation in Cuba and the Dominican Republic., Helix Science LLC | $35,000Helix Science will study microplastic abundance and collect plastic samples along the southwestern coast of Sri Lanka in the wake of a cargo vessel accident which released several container loads of plastic pellets and chemicals into the ocean., For many of us, our first interest in the ocean began with an interest in the large animals that call it home. Whether it be the awe inspired by a gentle humpback whale, the undeniable charisma of a curious dolphin, or the ferocious gaping maw of a great white shark, these animals are more than just the ambassadors of the sea. These apex predators and keystone species keep the ocean ecosystem in balance, and the health of their populations often serve as an indicator for the health of the ocean as a whole., Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative | $10,500ICAPO and its local partners will expand and improve hawksbill sea turtle research, conservation, and awareness in Nicaragua and Mexico while conducting outreach and awareness activities and providing socio-economic benefits to these impoverished communities with an ecotourism conservation program., University of Papua | $15,200The State University of Papua will engage local communities to expand a science-based program to protect leatherback sea turtle nests in Indonesia by using nest enclosures, shades, and egg relocation techniques to increase hatchling production and reduce nest destruction from beach erosion, high sand temperatures, illegal harvest, and predation., Fundacao Pro Tamar | $15,000Projeto TAMAR will improve loggerhead sea turtle conservation efforts and community participation at the Praia do Forte station, in Brazil by protecting nests, relocating those that are threatened, training local community members, and enhancing environmental awareness and community support., Dakshin Foundation | $7,500Dakshin Foundation will protect leatherback sea turtles on Little Andaman Island, India by focusing on tagging, habitat monitoring, satellite telemetry, and population genetics., Asociacion ProDelphinus | $6,000ProDelphinus will continue its High Frequency Radio Program which provides training and capacity building to artisanal fishers while at sea on safe methods for releasing turtles, seabirds, and dolphins; helps fishers in the election of their fishing areas; and provides helpful information during their fishery duties.

and reporting to the BIOTTA lead., One of the most significant barriers to progress in the marine conservation sector is a lack of real understanding about the vulnerability and connectivity of ocean systems. It is easy to think of the ocean as a vast, almost unlimited source of food and recreation with abundant animals, plants, and protected spaces. It can be difficult to see the destructive consequences of human activities along the coast and below the surface. This lack of awareness creates a significant need for programs that effectively communicate how the health of our ocean relates to climate change, the global economy, biodiversity, human health, and our quality of life., Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies | $3,000This grant from the Pier2Peer Fund will support Dr. Adekunbi Falilu to work with mentor Dr. Patrizia Vizeri to improve ocean acidification monitoring systems in Nigeria., Nigerian Institute for Oceanography and Marine Research | $2,000This grant from the Pier2Peer Fund will support Dr. Adekunbi Falilu to work with mentor Dr. Patrizia Vizeri to improve ocean acidification monitoring systems in Nigeria., Queen’s University Belfast | $5,000This grant from the Pier2Peer fund supports collaboration between the mentor (Patrizia Ziveri) and mentee (Sheck Sherif) to identify the perception of ocean acidification and climate change and gender perspective on adaptation in the fisheries sector in Liberia., , The Ocean Foundation is proud to support Save The Med (STM).

Through this project, STM identifies optimal MPA sites, collects survey data, develops science-based proposals for the creation and management of MPAs and engages local communities and stakeholders in educational and marine custody initiatives for the lasting protection of the MPAs., We are happy to provide funds to help Dr. Andrey Vinnikov gather and analyze available scientific materials about the distribution and amount of macrobenthos and megabenthos in the Chukchi and the northern Bering Seas, to identify potential Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems. This project will focus on key species of bottom-dwelling invertebrates that are most vulnerable to the impact of bottom trawling. Determining the region’s Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems will help inform approaches to reduce negative factors on seafloor ecosystems. This will especially work to protect them from bottom trawling as commercial fishing within Russia’s Exclusive Economic Zone expands into the Arctic.

Initial concepts may be submitted by public or private entities, including governments, private companies (including start-ups), NGO/CSO, United Nations entities, academic institutions, and intergovernmental organizations.Innovators can request from 50,000 USD to 250,000 USD and project time frames can range from one to two years. Project proposals must be implemented in and benefit stakeholders in developing countries but may be submitted by applicants in either developing or developed countries. All proposals should include a special focus on gender mainstreaming, livelihood creation, and poverty reduction. Concepts passing initial review and meeting OIC criteria will be invited to submit full proposals for further internal and external (""peer"") review and consideration.The first 'Challenge' which focused on SDG 14.1- Reduce Marine Pollution ran from 6 January - 5 March 2020. Meet the 2020 Ocean Innovators.The second call on sustainable fisheries ran from 9 March until 9 May 2021. Read the feature story on the UNDP Newsroom. The third call was launched on 10 February 2022 at the One Ocean Summit in Brest.",What It Does
220329,oceaninnovationchallenge_220329_3_001,https://oceaninnovationchallenge.org/#what-it-does,oceaninnovationchallenge,"Why It Matters The ocean faces unprecedented threats to the ecosystem goods and services it provides to humanity, from climate regulation to food security to coastal tourism. Despite some progress, many ocean challenges, from nutrient pollution to illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing to ocean acidification, continue to worsen. For most sectors that use and impact on the ocean, from fisheries to aquaculture to industrial agriculture, the `business as usual` scenario will not deliver the kinds of transformational change needed to move towards truly sustainable ocean use. A combination of technical innovation and cutting-edge policy, financial and economic incentives are needed to transform ocean-related sectors, both sea-based and land-based. At present, while there are a handful of relevant initiatives, these are limited in their sectoral scope. Solutions are required that cut across the unique innovation needs of each SDG14 target, whether it be reduction of plastics pollution, eliminating overfishing, or enhancing access for small scale fishers. The OIC seeks to identify and provide support to scale-up these solutions.",Why It Matters
220329,oceaninnovationchallenge_220329_3_002,https://oceaninnovationchallenge.org/#what-it-does,oceaninnovationchallenge,"The Ocean Innovation Challenge (OIC) is a unique new mechanism that has been designed to accelerate progress on SDG14 by identifying, financing, advising and mentoring truly innovative, entrepreneurial and creative approaches to ocean and coastal restoration and protection that sustains livelihoods and advances the 'blue economy'.The OIC seeks innovations that are transferable, replicable and scalable in order to achieve maximum catalytic impact.The goal of the OIC is to accelerate progress on SDG14 by catalysing replicable and scalable innovations - including technical, policy, economic and financial - that can be sustained and contribute directly to delivery of one or more SDG14 targets.""Innovation"" here can include both truly new approaches, or the transfer or adaptation of existing proven approaches to new contexts and/or locales.",What is the OIC

Increasingly, new technology is enabling ocean observations to be made remotely and/or autonomously. However, it is important that in situ sampling and measurements are conducted for ground truthing and calibration of the remote sensing and autonomous measurements for the accurate modelling of the ocean systems. To enable early career scientists to better understand the observations and to be able to monitor the biological, chemical and physical parameters of the oceans, research cruises for oceanographic sampling are necessary. However, there are relatively few opportunities for shipboard training available to young scientists. The objective of the Ocean Training Partnership is to pool infrastruture, resources and expertise to provide marine science graduates with offshore technical skills and experience onboard research vessels whilst building capacity in ocean observations. Mission Statement: The Partnership aims to develop a collaborative, sustainable approach to train competent marine science graduates and equip them with the technical skills and practical experience necessary to work across multiple oceanographic disciplines in challenging environments.",About

220329,okczoo_220329_3_001,https://www.okczoo.org/okc-living-classroom-grant-program,okczoo,"OKC Living Classroom Grant Program The monarch butterfly population has dropped by over 80 percent in the last 20 years. The main reason for this is habitat loss throughout the monarch’s migration and breeding range. Migrating monarchs funnel through Oklahoma in the spring and fall. Thus, creating and protecting monarch habitat in Oklahoma is critical for this iconic butterfly’s survival. The Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, in partnership with Oklahoma Monarch and Pollinator Collaborative, and National Wildlife Federation (NWF), seeks to increase habitat for monarchs and other pollinators by providing grants to Oklahoma City metro area schools to create monarch gardens. The gardens will include monarch host plants (milkweed) and nectar plants to provide a food source for monarchs along a vital part of their migration pathway. Selected schools will receive the following: Two professional development opportunities for teachers in July and August 2022 Awards of up to $1500 each to purchase garden supplies National Wildlife Federation’s Monarch Heroes Curriculum To apply for this grant, schools must agree to do the following: Maintain and commit resources to the garden for at least 3 years. Dedicate a minimum of 100 square feet, of planted space (not including pathways or other non-plant features), on school grounds to create monarch habitat that also serves as an outdoor classroom. Include native milkweed and nectar plants that attract monarchs in the garden. Plant less than 25% of the garden in containers. Planting in the ground or in raised beds is strongly preferred to ensure the garden’s longevity. Install the garden by November 1, 2022. Prevent use of herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides on or near the garden. Provide a letter committing support for the garden, signed by the principal, and presented on school letterhead.

220329,packard_220329_3_000,https://www.packard.org/about-the-foundation/our-investments/,packard,"Our Background The Packard Foundation, founded in 1964, operated as a small family foundation for over three decades. When Mr. Packard died in 1996, he left the bulk of his estate to the Foundation in the form of Hewlett-Packard Company stock. In 1999, when HP spun off its measurement and components businesses as Agilent Technologies, the Foundation held a two-stock portfolio. In 2003, after experiencing the volatility of the tech boom and bust, the Board of Trustees authorized the diversification of the portfolio and moved toward a liquid portfolio of stock index funds and bonds, while it evaluated next steps. In November 2007, the Foundation hired its first Chief Investment Officer, John Moehling, to recruit an investment team and build out an institutional-quality portfolio. Upon Moehling’s retirement in 2017, Kim Sargent, who has been with the Foundation since 2008, transitioned into the Foundation’s Chief Investment Officer role. Today, the Foundation’s investment team partners with a select group of talented investment partners across a variety of asset classes and geographies. We build strong, trusting partnerships with the goal to maximize the growth of our endowment so we can support effective people and organizations to achieve the Foundation’s mission. For more information, please find our Investment Committee Charter and Socially Responsible Investment Principles and Guidelines. Our Philosophy We believe that great investments begin with great people. Our strategy is to build strong partnerships with a select group of talented investment partners around the world. While our partners vary in terms of strategy, degree of specialization, and level of experience, they share common characteristics: passion, integrity, and strong investment judgment. We see partnership as a two-way street, and aim to be stable, engaged, and responsive limited partners. The Foundation’s mission and time horizon enable us to be long-term investors. We see having a long time horizon as a competitive advantage, and seek patient partners who share our view. We recognize that volatility may present interesting buying and selling opportunities. We do thorough work to develop confidence in our partners up front, with the intention of sustaining lasting relationships. We value deep, bottom-up, fundamental research because we believe it can lead to differentiated insights and conviction. We look to partner with independent thinkers who perform exhaustive and creative research. We are not macro investors. We are opportunistic, flexible investors. We don’t invest to check boxes or to fill quotas. We invest with people who optimize reward versus risk, and acknowledge that the best opportunities may manifest themselves in different forms. We believe the best way to build a portfolio is to allow ideas to originate from the bottom up, not to impose them from the top down. We build conviction based on high-quality research, enabling us to take concentrated positions in our portfolio, and limiting turnover where it is not necessary. We hope that our partners will do the same. We seek aligned incentives with our partners. We prefer to work with managers who are independently owned, focused on investment excellence first over asset size growth and product proliferation, and who are meaningful investors in their own funds. We have a small team pursuing a generalist model with a collaborative approach. We strive to avoid having siloes in our portfolio and on our team. Every investment we make gets compared against every other, and is subject to review by a team of people with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints. We believe that this approach will lead to a more concentrated portfolio, greater institutional knowledge, and deeper relationships with our partners. We strive for intellectual honesty and meritocracy in our process. We foster a culture in which independent thinking is valued and the best ideas can prevail, regardless of their origin.

In an evolving world with complex social and environmental challenges, the nonprofit, public, and private sectors all have important roles to play. While grantmaking is the Foundation’s primary tool for advancing our mission, mission investing can help organizations that are driving social and environmental change seize time-sensitive and higher-risk opportunities, tackle large-scale projects, attract new sources of capital, and scale efforts for maximum impact. We have dedicated up to $250 million of our endowment for mission investments – including loans and equity investments – which serve as a flexible tool for non-profit and for-profit organizations to tackle the world’s most pressing problems, sometimes on a much larger scale than we are able to do with grants alone.

McGovern Foundation is committed to bridging the frontiers of artificial intelligence, data science, and social impact. The Foundation is the legacy of IDG founder Patrick J. McGovern, who often said, “The best is yet to come.” He recognized the potential for information technology and neuroscience to democratize access to knowledge, improve the human condition, and advance social good. A generation of rapid advances in technology have led us to new possibilities at the intersection of information technology and neuroscience — artificial intelligence and data science. The promise of AI and data science represent the future Patrick J. McGovern always envisioned. With his optimism about what is possible, the Foundation invests in the exploration, enhancement, and development of AI and data science for good. Fierce Urgency of Now A sense of urgency drives our work. Technology, AI, and data increasingly influence our daily lives and society. We aim to create a shared understanding, language, and vision for how these tools can be ethically developed and applied for the greater good. At scale, AI and data can be instrumental in solving the world’s most pressing challenges, from the COVID-19 pandemic to climate change to health inequities. If we are to realize this transformative potential, we will need guiding frameworks for ethical AI and data, new approaches to privacy and stewardship of data, and bold innovations in AI applications. We believe philanthropy must play a significant role in supporting the diverse talent, courageous conversations, and new institutions needed to make change and reimagine the future. The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation is helping to build that future by serving as a convener, collaborator, and co-creator with other visionary leaders and organizations dedicated to advancing AI and data science for good. Our Culture and Values Core to our mission and vision are inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility– IDEA. We apply the IDEA framework to all we do, from growing a diverse team within the Foundation, to coalition building with organizations and people around the world, to promoting trust-based philanthropic relationships, and democratizing the development and rewards of AI and data. To build a better future in the digital era, the benefits of technological advancement must be shared by all. The Foundation invests in activities that lead to greater inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility in how AI and data are conceptualized, developed, applied, and deployed. As we undertake these goals, we are guided by these principles: Inclusion to create the conditions for belonging so all individuals are respected and valued and can participate fully in decision-making Diversity, to ensure a broad and representative community of stakeholders, partners, and allies Equity, to promote fairness, justice, and transparency in opportunity and distribution of resources so all people are able to thrive Accessibility, to create opportunity and welcoming spaces for engagement, participatory decision-making, and shared outcomes",About Us

Angell Family Foundation makes grants in three priority areas: Conservation, Performing Arts and Social Causes. Conservation The primary focus of the Foundation’s grant making in Conservation is the protection of the world’s oceans and species. The Foundation is interested in site-specific projects designed to improve the health of ocean habitats and to enhance their ability to withstand the challenges of climate change. In addition, the Foundation supports efforts to fund species protection, particularly regarding the seas’ apex predators. Eligible projects include research, conservation and/or restoration. Grants for other types of water-related conservation efforts may be considered on a limited basis. Performing Arts Performing arts grants focus on classical music and theater. Grantee organizations include performers, presenters (including broadcasters) and educators. We are currently considering grants to the Chicago area, the Mid-Atlantic Region (from Washington, D.C. north to Wilmington, DE) and the Cleveland area. Social Causes The goal of the Foundation’s grant making in Social Causes is to address the root causes of urban poverty and inequality. The Foundation seeks to support programs that help alter the life trajectories of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals and families toward a path to self sufficiency. Priority will be given to programs that emphasize evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs for low-income, disadvantaged youth and families of color. A limited number of grants will be considered for policy and advocacy efforts which address barriers that disproportionately impact low-income, communities of color. Priority areas are Education, Economic Empowerment, and Equity. The majority of Social Causes grants focus on the Chicago area.",About Us

Angell Family Foundation makes grants in three priority areas: Conservation, Performing Arts and Social Causes. Conservation The Foundation’s Conservation grant making focuses primarily upon issues of ocean conservation. Priorities within Conservation are: Supporting the creation of Marine Protected Areas Encouraging sustainable fisheries management Eliminating illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing Conserving the world’s shark and ray species Limiting plastics pollution and other ocean debris Preserving coral species and ecosystems Grant requests for other types of ocean-related conservation efforts may be considered on a limited basis Performing Arts The goal of the Performing Arts program is to support the presentation, perpetuation, and propagation of performing arts events, focusing on classical music and theater. Grantee organizations include professional performers, presenters, (including broadcasters) and educators. We are currently considering grants to the Chicago area, Cleveland, Detroit, and the Mid-Atlantic Region (from Washington, D.C. north to Philadelphia, PA). Please note that we currently do not fund dance or film. We also do not fund individual commissions. Social Impact The goal of the Foundation’s grantmaking in Social Impact is to promote equitable, safe, and thriving communities, particularly for low-income African, Latino/a, Asian, Arab and Native American (ALAANA). Achieving this goal requires long-term, comprehensive approaches led by those closest to the challenges and the possibilities. The Foundation is committed to understanding and addressing the root causes of persistent inequities for ALAANA families and communities, including the profoundly harmful impacts of structural racism and white supremacy. The Foundation funds efforts that promote access to meaningful life opportunities, such as quality education, networks of support and healing, and financial assets and employment. The Foundation also supports antiracist education, organizing, and advocacy efforts that have strong potential to advance meaningful systemic change. Public and private disinvestment has created unjust inequities in almost every realm of social, economic, and civic life of many ALAANA communities. At the same time, every neighborhood is home to creative and resilient individuals, families, businesses, and institutions. The Foundation’s grantmaking in Social Impact seeks to recognize both of these realities while it learns from and supports thoughtful and strategic changemakers. Priority areas are Education, Economic Empowerment, and Justice. For more details, please read the foundation’s paper, “A New Grantmaking Model for Social Impact.” *Please note, within Social Impact, we are currently only able to consider new grant requests within the Chicago metropolitan area. This does not apply to grant renewal requests. Types of Support General Operating This is the most flexible type of grant. Funds may be applied in any manner in which the organization sees fit, subject to its mission. Program/Project Grants These grants are targeted to a specific program or goal. Applicants must submit a program budget and narrative to support their applications. Education Education grants support programs which disseminate information crucial to the organization’s mission. They may include, but are not necessarily limited to: lectures, demonstrations, workshops, guided tours, exhibitions, and distribution of printed or online materials. The Foundation will NOT provide grants for: Religious institutions or other nonprofit organizations affiliated with a religion. Debt reduction Fundraising events Events that will have taken place before the determination of an award. The foundation does not fund in arrears. If applying for the Spring cycle, the date of events must begin after May 15th. For the Fall cycle, events must begin after December 1st. Eligibility Applicants must have a 501(c)(3) determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and be designated as a public charity.

They provide essential services and supply all our fresh water. However they continue to be degraded and converted to other uses. The Convention uses a broad definition of wetlands. It includes all lakes and rivers, underground aquifers, swamps and marshes, wet grasslands, peatlands, oases, estuaries, deltas and tidal flats, mangroves and other coastal areas, coral reefs, and all human-made sites such as fish ponds, rice paddies, reservoirs and salt pans.Under the “three pillars” of the Convention, the Contracting Parties commit to:work towards the wise use of all their wetlands;designate suitable wetlands for the list of Wetlands of International Importance (the “Ramsar List”) and ensure their effective management;cooperate internationally on transboundary wetlands, shared wetland systems and shared species.The present text of the Convention, as amended in 1982 and 1987, can be found here.The Strategic Plan for 2016-2024The Contracting Parties approved the Fourth Strategic Plan for 2016-2024 at COP12.

Between the COPs, the Parties are represented by the Standing Committee, which meets yearly. The Standing Committee is guided by the framework of the decisions made by the COP.Two advisory bodies develop technical guidance to help the Standing Committee and the COP formulate policies: the Scientific and Technical Review Panel (the STRP) and the Communication, Education, Participation and Awareness (CEPA) Oversight Panel. They are all supported by the Secretariat of the Convention on Wetlands and the International Organization Partners (IOPs) which the Parties have formally recognized as official partners of the Convention.The scope and focus of the Convention’s work is coordinated by means of a Strategic Plan and associated work plans which set out priority objectives and the actions expected or requested of the various bodies of the Convention.",The Bodies of the Convention

Paragraph 42 reads: “The wise use of wetlands and their resources will ultimately involve a range of actors well beyond those responsible for the management and maintenance of Wetlands of International Importance and other wetlands. This holds at local, national, regional and global levels where existing partnerships […] should be strengthened and new partnerships with civil society and the business sector forged […].”The Contracting Parties at COP12 confirmed their commitment to collaboration through Resolution XII.7. They recognized the need for focused fundraising activities to support the implementation of the Strategic Plan, and encouraged Parties to “enter into north-south, south-south and triangular cooperation”.The Convention on Wetlands is one of many multilateral environmental agreements. It works closely with other relevant global treaties, including the six other global biodiversity-related Conventions, with regional biodiversity agreements and with other relevant Conventions such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).The Convention has many agreements with non-governmental bodies, foremost among them six which have been formally approved by the Contracting Parties as International Organization Partners.The Convention also benefits from implementation support from private companies, in particular the Danone Group including the Evian brand.Contracting Parties can collaborate through Ramsar Regional Initiatives which support regional cooperation between a wide range of stakeholders.",Partnerships

Four game-changing and innovative solutions will each receive $250,000 for their work in one of the following fields: Education, Science, Environment, and Humanity. We invite anyone — individuals, for-profits, teams, non-profits, and B-corps — to apply. The deadline is April 10, 2020.Please note: in response to Covid-19, we want to strongly encourage applications that address the range of societal, health, and economic repercussions of the pandemic.Prize awardees will be working to improve education for all, including better access, teacher training, vocational programs, and tech integration.Prize awardees will be working on a range of issues related to the environment, including clean water, pollution, climate change, and the economic and social justice ramifications of environmental policies.Prize awardees will be working on a range of health, medical, and scientific advancements, including vaccines, autoimmune diseases, cancer research, and stem cell therapy.Prize awardees will be working on mitigating and solving for the unintended consequences of the vast technological, medical, and scientific advances that have come to define the 21st century.Education has been and is a pathway out of poverty for countless families regardless of income or geography. Students with even a basic education fare better and have greater opportunities than those who don’t. Schooling improves the overall health of a community, supports economic growth, empowers women and girls, and even combats climate change.And yet access to quality, affordable education is unattainable for too many. Overcrowded and dilapidated classrooms, lack of textbooks and school supplies, and too few or poorly trained teachers is often the norm. Gender and racial segregation, insufficient accountability and measurement, and inadequate government funding are far too common.Key topics to address in Education include but are certainly not limited to:Global temperatures are climbing, ice caps are melting, and droughts, wildfires, and super hurricanes are tearing their way across the planet. We must protect the oceans, reduce pollution, lower the emission of greenhouse gasses, and mitigate the human destruction of the environment.We must also curb the disproportionate burden of climate change and corporate action on vulnerable communities. Ample evidence suggests that poorer communities are routinely affected more severely by extreme weather or are targeted by policies and efforts that have negative and social environmental impact.Key topics to address in Environment include, but are certainly not limited to:Remarkable progress in science, health, and medicine in the past 10 years, has vastly expanded our understanding of the human body, our planet, and the environment. And yet, 1.6 billion people do not have access to basic healthcare. Over 40% of the world is at risk of Dengue fever and nearly 1 million people die of HIV/AIDS every year.As the global population ages and grows, mass migration continues, and conflict, drought, and famine create more acute challenges, the pace and scope of health related innovations and scientific efforts must not abate.Key topics to address in Science include, but are certainly not limited to:Humanity has made remarkable progress over the past 100 years. Average life expectancy has risen from 50 years to 72. Infant mortality rates have fallen 10-fold; and advances in computing, communications, transport, energy, and agriculture have transformed the ways in which we live, work, and play.As this progress continues we must ensure it is inclusive, transparent, and equitable. For too many, the gains and benefits of these advances have not been accrued equally. Hundreds of millions of people suffer from economic and social disruption, displacement, mass incarceration, unclean water, and large scale conflict — all major challenges that have arisen from our own progress and innovation.Key topics to address in Humanity include, but are certainly not limited to:Prize awardees will be working to improve education for all, including better access, teacher training, vocational programs, and tech integration.Education has been and is a pathway out of poverty for countless families regardless of income or geography.

Ample evidence suggests that poorer communities are routinely affected more severely by extreme weather or are targeted by policies and efforts that have negative and social environmental impact.Key topics to address in Environment include, but are certainly not limited to:Prize awardees will be working on a range of health, medical, and scientific advancements, including vaccines, autoimmune diseases, cancer research, and stem cell therapy.Remarkable progress in science, health, and medicine in the past 10 years, has vastly expanded our understanding of the human body, our planet, and the environment. And yet, 1.6 billion people do not have access to basic healthcare. Over 40% of the world is at risk of Dengue fever and nearly 1 million people die of HIV/AIDS every year.As the global population ages and grows, mass migration continues, and conflict, drought, and famine create more acute challenges, the pace and scope of health related innovations and scientific efforts must not abate.Key topics to address in Science include, but are certainly not limited to:Prize awardees will be working on mitigating and solving for the unintended consequences of the vast technological, medical, and scientific advances that have come to define the 21st century.Humanity has made remarkable progress over the past 100 years. Average life expectancy has risen from 50 years to 72. Infant mortality rates have fallen 10-fold; and advances in computing, communications, transport, energy, and agriculture have transformed the ways in which we live, work, and play.As this progress continues we must ensure it is inclusive, transparent, and equitable. For too many, the gains and benefits of these advances have not been accrued equally. Hundreds of millions of people suffer from economic and social disruption, displacement, mass incarceration, unclean water, and large scale conflict — all major challenges that have arisen from our own progress and innovation.Key topics to address in Humanity include, but are certainly not limited to:Four game-changing and innovative solutions each received $250,000 for their work in one of the following fields: Education, Science, Environment, and Humanity Based in Washington, D.C., USA, and with operations around the world 2020 Awardee | Humanity Generation is a global nonprofit that trains, places, and supports people of all ages into life-changing careers that were previously inaccessible to them.

220330,roddenberry_220330_3_003,https://roddenberryfoundation.org/our-work/roddenberry-fellowship/,roddenberry,"Launched in 2016, the Roddenberry Fellowship is a U.S.-based fellowship awarded to extraordinary leaders and advocates who use new and innovative strategies to safeguard human rights and ensure an equal and just society for all.The Roddenberry Fellowship is a 12-month program that offers Fellows $50,000 to take an existing initiative (e.g. campaign, organization) to the next level and amplify its impact OR to launch a new initiative.COVID-19 has and will continue to severely exacerbate existing and long-standing social inequities in marginalized and underserved communities. Individuals and families already experiencing housing instability, unemployment, limited health care access, and food insecurity will undoubtedly feel the pain more than others. For these communities, COVID-19 will amplify and compound economic, health, and racial inequities and reveal in stark and terrible terms the consequences of the historic disparities in which we live.This year, in addition to seeking to support efforts that will mitigate and alleviate the new realities for these communities, we are also introducing a new issue area – Health + Wellness – to identify solutions that address health inequities in underserved communities, such as access to basic care, affordable treatment, and mental health services.Up to 20 applicants working in one of five issue areas will be selected as 2022 Fellows:Fellows will work toward equity for all, including in our public schools, criminal justice system, and places of work.Asian American communities are facing an increase in hate crimes and bias as a result of the pandemic. The world witnessed George Floyd’s killing in 2020 — but today, African Americans are perpetually resisting violence against them by police. And marginalized communities and people of color continue to face discrimination in housing and labor markets, predatory lending practices, and diminished access to goods and services.These are a few examples of the bias and institutional racism that hamper all facets of our places of work, schools, criminal justice system, political structures, and financial systems.Prospective Fellows applying in the Civil Rights issue area will work to protect and advance the civil rights of minorities and people of color, including but certainly not limited to:Fellows will work to mitigate the human impact on our natural resources, neighborhoods, and communities.The threat to our natural resources has continued unabated over the past three years. Deregulation and rollbacks have benefited the fossil-fuel industry and corporate interests ahead of environmental impact and those most affected by polluted environments. City, state, and federal climate rules, policies, programs, and offices are disappearing or being weakened across the U.S. while attempts to discredit the scientific consensus on climate change remains an important part of these efforts.Prospective Fellows applying in the Environmental Protection issue area will work to raise awareness and develop strategies that lead to increased sustainability and environmental resilience, including but certainly not limited to:Fellows will work to ensure the rights of all newcomers to the US regardless of where they come from or why.Many unauthorized and informal workers, like street vendors, caregivers, or construction workers have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In the next year, many immigrant communities will continue to struggle with the precarious nature of their existence and the economic challenges caused by the pandemic.Prospective Fellows applying in the Immigrant & Refugee Rights issue area will work to champion the rights of all immigrants and refugees to increase their possibility for success and wellbeing, including but certainly not limited to:Fellows will work to secure rights and opportunities for everyone, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation.In the last few years, gender rights have taken a significant step forward: over 3 million women and girls in the U.S. gathered and marched for their rights. The #metoo movement exposed sexual violence and assault across all strata of society and forced a long overdue public reckoning. And in 2018, the most racially diverse and most female group of representatives was ever elected to the House of Representatives.In the year ahead, we must sustain the current momentum and build on these successes. Now is the time we increase the numbers of LGBTQIA and female candidates, in boardrooms, STEM fields, and in high-tech. It’s the year to narrow the wage gap, fight workplace discrimination, ensure equal rights for women, and the LGBTQIA community at all levels of society.Prospective Fellows applying in the LGBTQIA & Women’s Rights issue area will work to defend the rights of women and LGBTQIA individuals to secure their health and wellbeing, including but certainly not limited to:Fellows will work to overcome the barriers that prevent underserved communities from accessing the healthcare they need and deserve.The link between poverty and infectious disease is well-documented. Historic segregation and discrimination has disproportionately placed people of color in communities with a lack of basic opportunities for health and wellness. African-Americans, just 13% of the country’s population, have accounted for over a third of the cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. This toll has occurred as poor and vulnerable communities are already disproportionately burdened by other diseases such as asthma, diabetes, and stroke.Prospective Fellows applying in the Health & Wellness issue area will work on creative and novel solutions to overcome the barriers that prevent underserved communities from accessing the healthcare they deserve.

All proposals must be for charitable, educational, or scientific purposes and may not be for political or legislative purposes. 501c4 organizations are not eligible, but if you have a 501c3 arm of the organization, we can fund you as long as your work is legally separate from the 501c4 and the grant is earmarked as such. Please see our Rules for more information.Here are important dates to keep in mind and please review the timeline for more details. Fellowship funds will be awarded as grants to achieve impact described in the application, including but not limited to salaries, project development, and technology. Funding received from The Roddenberry Foundation must be used for the project’s purposes and to ensure success. Please see our sample agreement for more information.No, 501c3 status is not a requirement and we accept applications from individuals who are affiliated with movements, institutions, networks, or loosely structured organizations. However, The Roddenberry Foundation does not fund 501c4 organizations. Please see our Rules for more information.No, definitely not. Whether you’ve been doing this work for one year or a decade is less relevant than how you approach the issues, your vision for change, track record, and the impact you’ve made.The core of the Fellowship is unchanged. We are still focusing on five key issue areas – Civil Rights, Immigration & Refugee Rights, LGBTQIA and Women’s Rights, Environmental Protection, and Health & Wellness – and the duration, benefits, and award are the same. We have made changes to the applications and adjusted the criteria for the Fellowship to refine the process by which Fellows are selected.Yes, absolutely. There’s actually a question on the application where you can tell us how your ideas and initiative have evolved since you last applied.All information submitted in applications and supplemental materials is confidential and will be used solely by the Foundation for judging and selection. Please see our Privacy Policy for detailed information on how submitted information will be used.While we recognize that this work is collaborative, the Fellowship is designed to support individual activists and organizers. We know you work with other amazing people and that social change is a collective endeavor, but you must apply as an individual.We created a $2M organizational budget cap to help us find leaders of early-stage ideas, new projects, or long-standing but smaller organizations. We are interested in individuals and organizations that are on the cusp of growth rather than larger, more established organizations that generally have more access to resources.Generally speaking, we are interested in ambitious, creative initiatives likely to affect a significant portion of a target population, geography, or community. Hyper-local initiatives or those small in scope are great but not aligned with our Fellowship goals. You also don’t need to be well-known or have 50K twitter followers – we want individuals with a track record of success, a bold vision for the future, and initiatives with potential for large-scale change.Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications we receive, we are not able to provide individual feedback on applications. Our program is competitive. Oftentimes, this means that even strong applicants are turned away.Because we know the kind of investment required for these proposals, we do our best to make sure that re-application is as easy as possible. Please contact us if you need access to your previous application from 2020.The laws around what private foundations can fund regarding advocacy and lobbying are complicated. One of the core regulations though is that private foundations cannot earmark funds for lobbying. While Roddenberry Fellowship grants are general operating, the fellowship application explicitly asks what the grant will be used for. So if lobbying is a core part of a fellowship application, and that application is awarded a fellowship, that could be seen as the foundation earmarking funds for lobbying. To that - we strongly discourage applications that are primarily focused on lobbying. If you want more information on what exactly is advocacy or lobbying, the regulations around funding either, or how to get for grants from private foundations if you engage any sort of advocacy work, this is a great place to start: https://bolderadvocacy.org/resource/foundation-advocacy-grants-what-grantees-need-to-know/","A Call to Action, A Way Forward"

This is particularly true for already vulnerable and underserved communities for whom the pandemic has been catastrophic.In our global response, we have a singular opportunity for real transformation — a once-in-a-lifetime shot to profoundly reimagine and reshape how we rebuild post pandemic.The +1 Global Fund was launched with this opportunity in mind. It is the first fund of its kind powered by trust-based networks dedicated to identifying under-the-radar social entrepreneurs and innovators working in vulnerable and last-mile communities.The +1 Global Fund is driven by peer nominations within trusted networks.We partner with globally-recognized organizations who excel at identifying, vetting, and supporting leading social entrepreneurs. We then ask these social entrepreneurs to identify their peers — high-impact organizations working in last-mile and vulnerable communities across the globe.In each 12-week round, nominees are vetted by a team of researchers who gather information in lieu of time-consuming applications, and awardees are selected based on their innovative solutions, connections to the community, and potential for impact.Awardees receive $12,000, and the individual who nominated them receives $2,000 (shifting the scarcity mindset around funding). There are no applications, no deadlines, and no restrictions.That's how it works. Learn More.Identify leading social entrepreneurs and innovators within their networks working with communities hardest hit by Covid-19.Nominate up to 3 of their peers, anywhere in the world, combating the effects of Covid-19.If selected for funding, peer organizations receive $12,000 with no applications, reports, or restrictions (and the nominator receives $2,000).Identify leading social entrepreneurs and innovators within their networks working with communities hardest hit by Covid-19.Nominate up to 3 of their peers, anywhere in the world, combating the effects of Covid-19.If selected for funding, peer organizations receive $12,000 with no applications, reports, or restrictions (and the nominator receives $2,000).As COVID-19 swept across the world, countries, cities, and communities have been reshaped, social and health systems restructured, and inequalities amplified.As we begin to rebuild and address these challenges, we need new forms of action and collaboration that span the private and public sectors, including and in particular within philanthropy.If our goal is to emerge from this crisis stronger than we entered it, we — funders and philanthropists — need to do more and to do it differently. We need to operate with greater trust and transparency; invest in local leaders and vulnerable communities; and work together to experiment and take risks.With the +1 Global Fund we are seeking to shift philanthropic practices towards greater equity and inclusivity. In our model, nominations replace applications; partnerships supplant silos; and collaboration, trust, and efficiency are paramount. The path forward requires re-imagining the very foundations on which we work. Ensuring that we “build back stronger” will depend on it.The +1 Global Fund is rooted in a networked approach to identifying, vetting, and funding high-performing organizations. Our partners are globally-recognized organizations whose networks of social entrepreneurs and innovators identify their peers who are combating Covid-19 in their communities.A global nonprofit changing the way the world tackles poverty by investing in sustainable businesses, leaders, and ideas.The mission of The Resolution Project is to develop socially responsible young leaders and empower them to make a positive impact today.Ashoka builds and cultivates a community of change leaders who see that the world now requires everyone to be a changemaker.The Obama Foundation Fellowship supports outstanding civic innovators—leaders who are working with their communities to create transformational change and addressing some of the world’s most pressing problems.Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) is USAID’s open innovation program that tests and scales creative solutions to any global development challenge.CARE works around the globe to save lives, defeat poverty and achieve social justice.

220330,roddenberry_220330_3_005,https://roddenberryfoundation.org/approach/,roddenberry,"Our grantmaking is structured around our initiatives rather than traditional grants or grant cycles. Underpinning all of our initiatives is a core set of values informed by our time and experiences as grant-seekers, non-profit leaders, teachers, community members, and volunteers. These values were developed in response to what we found most frustrating and ineffective in our interactions with funders and foundations and designed to reflect a different approach to meeting the needs of those seeking support. We prioritize problem-solving over paperwork; streamlined processes and straightforward communication over cumbersome reporting and quarterly grant cycles. We try to meet our community where they are and act with the same sense of urgency that the issues deserve. Can one say one’s humble and actually be humble? We hope so! It means that we know that no one institution has all — or even a few — of the answers. We also know that our community of Fellows, Catalyst grantees, Prize awardees, judges, and partners have far greater insight into the issues and solutions than we ever will. We follow their lead. Philanthropists — and foundations in particular — need to take more risks. Period. At TRF, we emphasize experimentation, creativity, and risk-taking for ourselves and seek it out from those organizations and individuals we support. To achieve large scale, systemic social change we (all of us) need as many talented individuals, from all walks of life, to play a role (big or small). Social change is a communal endeavor and the more people from different and diverse backgrounds who are engaged in this work the better. No one has a lock on a great idea or a world-changing initiative. Change can be generated by any individual, team, organization, or business whose creativity and imagination redefine notions of what can be done and how. There are no disqualifiers. No one idea or organization will solve poverty, income inequality, hunger or any of the myriad issues we seek to address. Complex problems require sophisticated, thoughtful solutions. While we love big and bold ideas, we are not looking for one single path or “magic” approach — even if it is an app.",Our Approach

Anyone who has or is considering a career in science should be encouraged, supported, welcomed and have an equal chance to excel. Our work on diversity in science includes addressing barriers to participation and success and actions to support and inspire change. Education Being educated in science and mathematics enables people to make informed choices about their life and work, empowers them to shape scientific and technological developments, and equips them to prosper in today’s rapidly-changing, knowledge-focused economies. Our work on education and skills includes an analysis of how the UK’s education systems should change and work with teachers to support innovative science in schools. Grants The Royal Society provides a range of grant schemes to support the UK scientific community and foster collaboration between UK based and overseas scientists. Through its Research Fellowships and funding programmes, the Society works in partnership with universities and industry to support excellent scientists. History of science The Society has one of the most important scientific heritage collections in the world. It uses its collections to support academic research in the history of science and to engage the public with science by sharing stories of past Fellows who include some of the most famous scientists in history. Industry and translation Translating ideas and skills from the research base to industry, business and the wider community is crucial to future prosperity. The Society’s work on industry and innovation promotes the value and importance of science by connecting academia, industry and government. International Science is a global endeavour which bridges national boundaries and requires international discussion and collaboration. The Royal Society has a long history of working internationally and we continue to run programmes to develop partnerships between UK researchers and scientists based overseas, as well as bring together policy makers and scientists from around the world. Journals The Society published the first ever scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions in 1665.

220330,scherman_220330_3_000,https://www.scherman.org/mission-and-history,scherman,"Mission and HistoryThe Scherman Foundation supports the arts and organizations that use community organizing and advocacy to build a more just, sustainable, and equitable New York, as well as those that strengthen democracy and advance environmental and reproductive justice nationwide. In its grantmaking, the Foundation prioritizes movement-building, long-term general operating grants, and funding groups led by and serving Black, Indigenous, and People of Color whose work addresses and dismantles systemic racism. The Foundation has a special commitment to New York City, focusing its Arts and Strengthening New York Communities programs exclusively there. The Foundation was founded in 1941 by Harry Scherman, founder of the Book-of-the-Month Club, as a small family foundation with average annual giving of about $100,000. He led the Foundation for almost 30 years, providing critical support to a broad range of organizations including the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Young Concert Artists, Mannes College of Music, the Little Orchestra Society, the New York Public Library, and several Jewish philanthropies.Upon Scherman’s death in 1969, Axel Rosin, the husband of Katharine Scherman Rosin—Harry Scherman’s daughter—became President of the Foundation. Mr. Rosin also served as President, and then Chairman of the Board, of the Book-of-the-Month Club from 1960 until its merger with Time Inc. in 1977. A portion of the merger proceeds went to the Foundation, as did substantial bequests from Harry Scherman, his wife Bernardine, and their son Tom, increasing its endowment and annual giving ten-fold. These bequests enabled the hiring of a professional staff and the expansion of giving to include support for organizations in the fields of conservation, peace and disarmament, community action and social welfare, human rights and liberties, family planning, and the arts. During this period, the Foundation provided early support to pioneering organizations including the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Physicians for Social Responsibility, as well as special projects including the creation and distribution in 1975 of a Vietnamese/English language and life guide for newly arrived immigrants. Distinguished Board members have included William Allen White, Dorothy Canfield Fisher, Felix Rohatyn, Helen Edey, George Gallup, and Archibald Murray. Harry Scherman Axel Rosin Katharine S. Rosin In 1993, Rosin became Chairman, and Dr. Karen Rosin Sollins succeeded her father as President. Dr. Sollins assumed the role of Chair in 1997 when the roles of President and Executive Director were merged into a single professional position. Staff leadership has been provided by David Freeman (1978-1993), Sandra Silverman (1993-2009), and Mike Pratt (2009-present).The Scherman Foundation’s core program focuses on six issue areas: Arts, Environment, Democracy, Human Rights and Liberties, Reproductive Rights and Justice, and Strengthening New York Communities.In 2012, through the generosity of a bequest from Katharine Scherman Rosin (a distinguished author and longtime Foundation board member), the Foundation established a new giving program, The Katharine S. and Axel G.

220330,sharkconservation_220330_3_001,https://www.sharkconservationfund.org/what-we-fund/,sharkconservation,"The Shark Conservation Fund is proud to support a comprehensive array of projects which together are building a portfolio of hope for sharks and rays centered around our three core objectives and five work streams. Three core objectives 1. Ensuring effective regulation of global trade of sharks and ray products Underpinning SCF’s entire mission is the goal of ensuring that the global trade in shark and ray products is effectively regulated. As one of the world’s earliest and most powerful multinational environmental agreements, CITES provides the overarching legal framework for driving trade controls in sharks and rays. Prior to the CITES meeting in 2013, when five species of sharks and all manta rays were listed under Appendix II, the international trade of shark products was essentially unregulated. The 2013 listings meant that, for the first time, countries had to prove that any catch of these species was sustainable before engaging in trade. At the 2019 meeting, 18 species were added to Appendix II, for a total of 46 species accounting for about 25% of the Hong Kong fin trade. Three species of Hammerhead Sharks and Mako sharks are now listed on Appendix II, but are still top species in the fin trade. There is much more work to be done. SCF supports efforts to list the remaining top species of sharks and rays targeted by global trade on CITES Appendices and to implement those listings.Securing CITES listings and supporting their full implementation globally and in key countries forms the central axis of SCF’s approach. The impact of these listings goes much further than just protecting the most endangered, commercially valuable species. Once a species is listed, SCF directs funding to support implementation in target regions and countries at every level. The robust regulation, monitoring and enforcement that CITES listings require will drive better fisheries management and ultimately more transparent and sustainable management for all shark and ray species. 2. Preventing the extinction of the most imperiled sharks and rays SCF focuses on reversing the decline of the most endangered sharks and rays through protecting imperiled endemic sharks and the most endangered families of sharks. Imperiled endemics are species that are endangered or could become endangered which are only found in certain regions or countries. SCF seeks to protect imperiled endemic sharks in countries with high concentrations of those species, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and South Africa.SCF advances protections for the most endangered families of sharks and rays – primarily Sawfish, Angel Sharks, and Hammerhead Sharks – in two key ways. First, by enhancing legal protections and conservation initiatives in priority countries with high concentrations of these species, e.g., the Canary Islands and the Bahamas. Secondly, by supporting the protection of widely distributed and/or highly migratory imperiled sharks and rays through targeted actions by international fisheries and marine conservation forums. 3. Combating unsustainable shark and ray fishing globally Sharks are targeted within directed fisheries and caught and retained as valuable bycatch in fisheries targeting other species. In many countries the health of shark and ray populations is unknown, yet they are still caught and sold for their meat and fins. Shark bycatch is significant in high seas tuna and swordfish fisheries — in some cases, they are really shark fisheries with an incidental catch of tunas and billfishes. Some species of sharks have characteristics that make them better suited to withstand fishing pressure. Since shark and ray fishing is an important source of protein and income in many countries, combating unsustainable shark fishing is vital. SCF focuses on engaging the tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (tuna RFMOs), which have authority over fisheries in 91% of the world’s ocean surface and oversight over some of the world’s largest pelagic shark fisheries, as well as implementation of those policies at the national level in target countries, including Indonesia, Argentina, Malaysia, and Taiwan.

The fund encourages engagement with private sector entities interested in exploring the economic potential of genetic resources and facilitate the transfer of appropriate technologies. Through the implementation of this type of project, countries should be generating additional information that can help to understand their capacities and needs on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS), with focus on the provisions from existing policies, laws and regulations affecting genetic resources. Brochure on the NPIF in English and Japanese Financial Information Adaptation Fund The Adaptation Fund (AF) was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. It was established under the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and since 2010 has committed funds for localized climate adaptation and resilience activities. Initiatives are based on country needs and priorities. AF is one of the most innovative and unique climate funds, and has achieved impressive progress in just a few short years. It has proven its effectiveness as a highly efficient and transparent Fund for channeling adaptation finance to developing countries by pioneering Direct Access, in which accredited National Implementing Entities (NIEs) can directly access climate finance and manage projects from design through implementation while building the country’s own local and national adaptive capacity. AF-funded projects are implemented around the world through accredited National Implementing Entities, Multilateral Implementing Entities and Regional Implementing Entities. The Fund also has a growing Readiness Programme that provides capacity building workshops, small technical assistance grants and south to south cooperation to facilitate accreditation of new implementing entities and reach more vulnerable communities with urgently needed climate adaptation solutions. The original primary source of revenue for the Fund – the sale of Certified Emission Reduction credits through a 2% levy on UN Clean Development Mechanism projects that help meet Kyoto’s emission reduction targets – has drastically diminished due to market forces. The Fund is increasingly attracting funds through developed country and private donations by delivering concrete, effective and localized projects and continuing to innovate through pioneering programs like Direct Access, human-rights-based social and environmental risk management policies, a gender policy and action plan, and flexible finance modalities. The Fund is also in high demand, receiving record numbers of project proposals in 2015. Projects are country-driven, replicable and scalable. Further, the Paris Climate Agreement included adaptation as a key component in the global response to climate change and recognized that the AF may serve the Agreement, subject to a process that has already started. The Adaptation Fund is overseen by the Adaptation Fund Board, which has a majority of members that represent developing countries and meets in person twice a year to review policy and project proposals.

220330,thegef_220330_03_002,https://www.thegef.org/topics/biodiversity,The Gef,"Main Issue Biodiversity is the variability among Earth’s terrestrial, freshwater, and marine organisms, as well as the ecosystems of which they are part. Biodiversity is crucial to the future of all life on the planet, and is also the foundation for the ecosystem goods and services that enable human societies to thrive. Biodiversity provides us with food, water, and materials, as well as services such as climate regulation, pollination, disaster protection, and nutrient cycling. Biodiversity thus is an indispensable asset that makes critical contributions to sustainable development. Managing this asset requires full engagement of governments at all levels, civil society organizations, the private sector, indigenous peoples and local communities, and others. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which came into force in 1993, is the global policy framework for action to maintain biodiversity for future generations. There has been some progress in conserving and sustainably using biodiversity and ecosystems at local and national levels over the past several decades, but not at the scale necessary to stem the ongoing tide of biodiversity loss. Changing the trajectory of biodiversity loss means addressing its five main direct drivers: habitat change; overexploitation or unsustainable use; invasive alien species; climate change; and pollution. These critical drivers of biodiversity loss are intensifying, particularly habitat loss driven by the expansion of agriculture. Featured Content Image Publication Biodiversity Feature Story Safeguarding unique ecosystems in the South Pacific February 14, 2022 What We Do The GEF provides financial resources for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to implement the CBD. The goal of the GEF’s biodiversity strategy is to maintain globally significant biodiversity in landscapes and seascapes. To achieve this goal, GEF investments focus on three main objectives: Mainstream biodiversity across sectors as well as landscapes and seascapes; Address direct drivers to protect habitats and species; and Further develop biodiversity policy and institutional frameworks. Support is primarily focused on 1) sustainably managing biodiversity in productive landscapes and seascapes and ensuring that the impact of productive sectors on biodiversity is avoided, or substantially reduced or minimized; 2) enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of protected area systems; 3) supporting the complete and effective implementation of the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols: and 4) improving biodiversity policy, planning, and review. Please see GEF-7 Biodiversity Strategy for a detailed description of programing and investment opportunities. Results The GEF has invested more than $3.5 billion to conserve biodiversity, and use it sustainably. This investment has leveraged over $10 billion in additional funds, supporting 1,300 projects in more than 155 countries. GEF funds have improved the management of more than 860 million hectares of protected areas and parks around the world, an area larger than the size of Brazil. We have also helped countries sustainably use and manage biodiversity within more than 350 million hectares of productive landscapes and seascapes. The GEF has supported the development of National Biosafety Frameworks in 126 countries, and their subsequent implementation under the Cartagena Protocol. GEF support has also been critical in bringing into force the Nagoya Protocol, and a growing part of the portfolio is building country capacity to implement the Protocol. Looking Ahead Over the next four years (GEF-7), the goal of GEF’s biodiversity strategy will be to maintain globally significant biodiversity in landscapes and seascapes. To achieve this goal, GEF investments will contribute to the following objectives: Mainstream biodiversity across sectors as well as landscapes and seascapes; Address direct drivers to protect habitats and species; and Further develop biodiversity policy and institutional frameworks. GEF support to biodiversity mainstreaming will focus on sustainably managing biodiversity in productive landscapes and seascapes and ensuring that the impact of productive sectors on biodiversity is avoided, or substantially reduced or minimized. This will require improved land-use planning, sectoral policies, and economic decision-making that are informed by the valuation of biodiversity and the ecosystem good and services that biodiversity provides to society in addition to improved biodiversity management approaches, including harnessing biodiversity for sustainable agriculture. In addition, GEF will continue to build capacity of countries to combat the illegal wildlife trade and the unsustainable use of species, with priority action on threatened species and wildlife. In order to addressing direct drivers to protect habitats and species, the GEF will support investments to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of protected area systems primarily. In addition, GEF will continue to invest in the prevention and control of invasive alien species particularly in island ecosystems. GEF will support the complete and effective implementation of the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols and to improve biodiversity policy, planning, and review (enabling activities).

220330,thegef_220330_03_003,https://www.thegef.org/topics/chemicals-and-waste,The Gef,"Main Issue Toxic chemicals are found in all ecosystems on Earth, including Antarctica and the most remote seas, affecting biodiversity, agricultural production, water quality, and human health. Over 100 million man-made chemicals and chemical formulations are used in every sector of the industrial economy. Many chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury, travel over large distances through air, water currents and in migratory species. Some POPs can remain in the human body for more than 50 years. Mercury, an element, is infinitely persistent. When used improperly or disposed of unsafely, chemicals pose significant risks for both the environment and human health: scientists estimate that just about every person on the planet carries within their body a large number of chemical contaminants that have an unknown impact on their well-being. Due to the global impact on human health and the environment some of these highly dangerous chemicals are controlled by international law. Among the most significant agreements that cover the way chemicals are used and managed at the end of life are the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Despite the advances made under these agreements, the production, use, and disposal of chemicals are rapidly increasing in developing countries and countries in economic transition. These rapid changes increase economic opportunities, but they must be matched by enhanced programs and initiatives for sound chemicals and waste management. The cost to national economies of human and environmental exposure to harmful chemicals is often unrecognized, but can be substantial. Complicating matters further, in the pursuit of new materials and chemicals many manufacturers do not always conduct sufficient analysis of the potential harmful impacts of their products before they are used commercially, which often results in significant harm to humans as well as wild species and terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Neonicotinoid pesticides, for example, which are the most widely used insecticides in agriculture have now been linked to the current decline in bee populations. Barriers in the private sector often hinder the possibility of change in the way chemicals are produced and managed. Small companies in particular find it difficult to afford ‘greener’ practices. Furthermore, scientists and regulatory agencies lack robust data and information on toxic chemicals, partly due to weak capacity in developing countries, which in turn affects the possibilities of bringing science-based reports to policy makers. Featured Content Image Publication Chemicals and Waste Image Publication planetGOLD 2020/2021 Annual Progress Report What We Do The GEF is charged with eliminating the most harmful chemicals, which are covered by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The GEF also supports the achievement of broader sound management of chemicals and waste through its support to the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), the United Nations policy framework to promote chemical safety around the world. The GEF has developed two key strategic objectives regarding chemicals and waste: Develop the enabling conditions, tools, and environment for the sound management of harmful chemicals and wastes; Reduce the prevalence of harmful chemicals and waste and support the implementation of clean alternative technologies/substances. The implementation support for the chemicals and waste conventions by the GEF provides both the opportunity for Parties to these conventions to meet their obligations under the Conventions and to use the entry point of the Conventions to transform their management of chemicals and ultimately use and produce chemicals without suffering their harmful impacts. The GEF’s work on chemicals and waste focuses on four main programs in GEF-7: The Industrial Chemicals Program seeks to eliminate or significantly reduce chemicals subject to international agreements by supporting programs that address: chemicals and waste at the end of life; chemicals that are used or emitted from or in processes and products; and management of waste containing these chemicals. The Agricultural Chemicals Program addresses the agricultural chemicals that are listed as persistent organic pollutants under the Stockholm Convention and agricultural chemicals that contain mercury or its compounds. Where the chemicals are in use, the GEF fosters efforts to introduce alternatives. The Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States Program addresses the sound management of chemicals and waste through strengthening the capacity of sub- national, national, and regional institutions and strengthening the enabling policy and regulatory framework in these countries. The Enabling Activities Program supports enabling activities under the Stockholm Convention and the Minamata Convention, and supports global monitoring of chemicals. Results For the GEF-7 replenishment, donors pledged approximately $600 million as a commitment to ridding the world of the most harmful chemicals through the GEFs chemicals and waste programming, accounting for 15% of the total replenishment commitment. As of June 30, 2018, the GEF has cumulatively programmed $1.2 billion in projects that support the Stockholm Convention since its adoption in 2001. This GEF investment has leveraged approximately $4.8 billion in co-financing to bring the total value of the GEF POPs portfolio to over $6 billion. Looking Ahead More and more chemicals are being produced and put into everything people consume, from cell phones to food and drinking water. At the same time, however, industry itself is beginning to shift to more sustainable ‘green’ supply chains and manufacturing. How can the chemicals industry accelerate this switch? What are the challenges ahead, and what innovations and global coalitions are needed? The GEF is a catalyst for both governments and the private sector as they address these questions and work to eliminate or reduce harmful chemicals and waste. GEF’s programming strategy for chemicals and waste builds on its past work in policy and priority setting, piloting technologies and techniques to build best practices, and progressively working with the private sector to help foster sound management of chemicals and waste. To achieve transformational change, GEF projects seek closer integration with the private sector and global supply chains. GEF’s Global Opportunities for Long-term Development in the Artisanal Scale Gold Mining sector (GOLD) program, for example, offers a new model for unlocking resources to address mercury pollution from gold mining and has strong private sector engagement, including major jewelers, electronics manufacturers, gold refiners, and commercial banks. The GEF can help to convene the relevant stakeholders and function as an honest broker in facilitating the work needed to help transform the chemicals industry and related products and materials streams. GEF-7 will explore the important synergies between the International Waters and the Chemicals and Waste focal areas to address specifically the challenge of marine litter and micro-plastics. Waste consisting of plastics can contribute to the POPs challenge as POPs contained in plastics can be released in the environment including oceans, if not properly managed. Marine litter in the form of micro-plastics to a significant extent derives from land-based activities and should also be seen in the context of waste management issues dealt with under this focal area. Recognizing the need to transform the entire life cycle of plastics to reduce marine plastic pollution, the GEF will invest in a few strategic Circular Economy initiatives to promote the adoption of closed loop production and consumption patterns instead of traditional linear take-make-waste approaches. Investments will be focusing on public/ private investments to transform the plastic life cycle.",chemicals-and-waste
220330,thegef_220330_03_004,https://www.thegef.org/topics/climate-change,The Gef,"Main Issue The Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) entered into force in November 2016; marking a new era of climate action that will put the world on a path to eliminating carbon from the global economy by the second half of the century. Taking action on climate change means adopting and implementing ambitious programs to limit emissions of greenhouse gases to levels compatible with the well-being of the ecosphere, while supporting communities around the world to adapt to the unavoidable impacts of the climatic changes that are already being observed. It also means embracing the potential of the green economy - a more sustainable way of life that balances economic, social, and environmental priorities. We can mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a variety of ways. These include promoting greater energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, as well as building more sustainable urban transport. Since land, forests, and oceans store carbon, we also need to adopt smarter ways to preserve and restore these “carbon sinks.” Adaptation helps people cope with increased risks to their lives and livelihoods from a changing climate. Climate change is already affecting weather patterns, water resources, crop yields, and marine ecosystems. The poor, who are least able to cope, are the hardest hit. Increasingly, policymakers recognize the need to integrate climate-resilient strategies into long-term development programs. What We Do The GEF has several key roles to play under the Paris Agreement. The GEF serves as part of the financial mechanism of the Agreement, which also established a process for ensuring that all actions on climate change are fully transparent with a mechanism for helping countries meet that goal. The GEF’s climate change mitigation strategy, which is financed through the GEF Trust Fund, supports developing countries as they make transformational shifts towards low emission development pathways with three fundamental objectives: Promoting innovation and technology transfer for sustainable energy breakthroughs Demonstrating mitigation options with systemic impacts, by strengthening interaction and integration between climate change mitigation and the other GEF focal areas Mainstreaming mitigation concerns into sustainable development strategies through the continuous support of enabling conditions in developing countries. More details on each one of the objectives above are provided in the Climate Change Mitigation page. The GEF’s climate change adaptation strategy, which is financed through the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), aims at supporting developing countries to move to a climate resilient development pathway while reducing exposure to the immediate risks posed by climate change. The GEF adaptation strategy hinges upon three main pillars: Reduce vulnerability and increase resilience through innovation and technology transfer for adaptation Mainstream adaptation and resilience for systemic impact Foster enabling conditions for effective and integrated adaptation. More details on the LDCF and SCCF climate adaptation programming are available on the Climate Change Adaptation page. All our projects and programs can be consulted in our database for detailed descriptions of activities and results. Results GEF-funded projects have had a tangible impact on climate change: Reducing the vulnerability of almost 27 million people in more than 130 countries Supporting nearly 1,000 climate change mitigation projects expected to contribute 8.4 billion tons of direct and indirect GHG emission reductions over time. Looking Ahead Under GEF-7, the GEF will continue to foster the shift to a low-carbon economy by supporting creative thinking and innovative financing. The GEF’s efforts are structured to address the key decisions for the Paris Agreement, and to further support climate action in developing countries. The framework is aligned with the GEFs innovative project designs, proven track record of support for technology transfer, and ability to attract private sector co-financing. The establishment and operationalization of the Green Climate Fund has added to the evolving context in which the GEF operates. The GEF-7 Climate Change Focal Area Strategy is complementary to programming by the Green Climate Fund and other climate funds and lays the foundation for enhanced climate action by harnessing synergies across the different focal areas and building on the GEFs record of driving innovation.",climate-change
220330,thegef_220330_03_005,https://www.thegef.org/topics/forests,The Gef,"Main Issue What We Do Results Looking Ahead Main Issue Forests cover more than 30 percent of the earths land surface and are key to maintaining biodiversity, protecting land and water resources, and mitigating climate change. And yet, forests face significant and increasing threats, such as rapid development and competing land uses - particularly for farming and grazing lands, commercial plantations, and infrastructure expansion have all cut wide swaths through the world’s forests. Since 1990, the extent of the world’s forests has declined by over nine percent. Even though the rate of decline has slowed, according to a recent estimate from FAO, 10 million hectares of forests are lost every year (an area the size of South Korea). As the effects from climate change and human population continues to increase, competition for land will only intensify. This growth threatens the vital environment services that forests provide, such as the maintenance of biodiversity, climate stability, integrity of land, and delivery of fresh water, while undermining the livelihoods of an estimated 1.6 billion forest-dependent people, with consequences on migration and security. This current trend demonstrates the urgent need to further advance the forest protection, management, and restoration approaches that are at the core of sustainable forest management (SFM). What We Do Support from the GEF helps developing countries, which often face an array of economic, ecological, and political challenges, comply with the three Rio Conventions on biodiversity, desertification, and climate change. As the unique financial mechanism of the conventions, the GEF focuses much of its effort on helping governments comply with convention requirements and achieve SFM, providing subsequent environmental benefits in the biodiversity, climate, and land degradation areas. Forests are often the focus of complex social structures and interaction, where an integrated approach can provide multiple benefits. As a result, many GEF projects, even when forests are not the only focus, contributes to the GEF’s forests portfolio through a landscape-based approach. The GEF offers support for a wide range of SFM tools such as: protected area establishment and management; integrated landscapes planning and management; forest restoration; certification of timber and non-timber forest products; payment for ecosystem services schemes; financial mechanisms related to carbon; development and testing of policy frameworks to slow the drivers of undesirable land-use change; and work with local communities to develop alternative livelihoods to reduce pressure on forests. The GEF-7 Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Impact Program focuses on fragile and threatened biomes such as the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and dryland sustainable landscapes where transformative impacts and multiple environmental benefits can be achieved. Investments in these globally important ecosystems can transform the trajectory of harmful land uses and promote collaboration in enhancing and protecting ecosystems that span more than one country. These biomes are important for biodiversity and carbon storage and provide livelihoods and subsistence to communities that rely on forests and agriculture for their survival thus qualifying as “key ecosystems” where SFM has critical value. These globally important ecosystems offer an opportunity to change the future development trajectory from natural resource depletion and biodiversity erosion, to one based on natural capital management and productive landscapes. Because of their size and scale, protecting these biomes requires a comprehensive and large set of investments, as fragmented and isolated projects will not be sufficient to maintain the integrity of these vital ecosystems. The GEF is addressing global tropical deforestation through the Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration (FOLUR) Impact Program. This ambitious and innovative program brings together 27 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to address deforestation and forest degradation with a system-wide approach that shapes strategies and engages stakeholders at the landscape level and along the food value chains. The FOLUR program supports the needed transformation toward sustainable production systems for food commodities and staple crops, which in return provides a wide range of environmental benefits including improved land management, biodiversity conservation, landscape restoration, and greenhouse gas emission mitigation. Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is the rehabilitation of a whole deforested or degraded forest landscape and brings back ecological functionality and local livelihoods. Global and regional restoration initiatives have set ambitious goals to regain healthy and functional forest ecosystems around the world. In GEF-7, forest and landscape restoration is embedded as a critical element within the SFM and FOLUR impact programs. As a member of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF), the GEF participates in major global forest-related meetings and is an active partner in the global forest policy dialogue, notably under the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF). Results Since its inception in 1992, the GEF has funded around 500 forest-related projects, investing around $3.4 billion and leveraging an additional expected amount of $17 billion to promote SFM in developing countries around the world. Midway through GEF-7, the many projects and programs still underway are expected to sustainably improve the management of over 305 million hectares of forest landscapes for multiple benefits and services; restore more than 7.6 million hectares of forest lands; mitigate the emission of 1,294 million tCO2e and enhance the management of 28 million hectares of protected areas in forest landscapes. Looking Ahead Managing forests for environmental, economic, and climate benefits requires working across all sorts of boundaries: across countries and between jurisdictions in country; from local communities and indigenous peoples to national line ministries and international treaty organizations; and between government ministries. It also requires cross-sectoral coordination at national levels and the involvement of many different actors and stakeholders in meaningful ways. The role of the private sector has become more significant in improving the sustainability of many sectors operating in forests around the word. Promising progress is being made with large companies that produce or trade global commodities like soy and beef. However, small and medium-sized enterprises generally face more costly barriers to improve production practices and achieving scale in the commercialization of their products. The GEF is partnering with emerging platforms that are aiming to set reimbursable investment funds for small and medium rural producers operating in the key forest areas such as the Amazon. National, state, and commercial banks are willing to partner in joint pilot initiatives that pursue differentiated financial arrangements for public credit lines directed at small farmers and suppliers. Managing forests also must include finding a path out of poverty for the millions of people who depend on them for their welfare and future. This requires finding new production technologies; transforming ecological goods and services for growing markets locally and internationally in a way that protects the natural capital that produces these goods and services; and better valorizing the conservation of nature. That very sustainable production method then serves as a competitive advantage in those markets while providing ownership opportunities for local and indigenous communities in the business ecosystem so they are not just labor or consumers but drivers of economic change.",forests
220330,thegef_220330_03_006,https://www.thegef.org/topics/international-waters,The Gef,"Main Issue Healthy marine and freshwater ecosystems are critical to sustaining life on earth, and they underpin and connect ecosystems, human health, and key economic sectors. Yet they face unprecedented threats. Ocean ecosystems are under pressure from climate change, acidification, habitat loss, pollution, fishing, shipping, and seabed mining. Freshwater ecosystems face threats from climate change, urbanization, and increasing food demand. Marine and freshwater ecosystems are often cross national boundaries; more often than not, several nations share common groundwater aquifers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, or coral reefs. Globally, more than 300 watersheds and over 360 aquifers cross the political boundaries of two or more countries. These watersheds, which cover about half of the Earth’s land surfaces, are home to about 40 percent of the global population. Conserving these ecosystems and ensuring they are managed sustainably thus requires that countries coordinate actions to secure a healthy environment for present and future generations. Given the critical role of marine and freshwater ecosystem and the threats they face, strong, informed management approaches are essential. GEF experience demonstrates that sustainable environmental management of transboundary resources require a common understanding of what pressures the shared ecosystems are facing, coupled with national and regional investment plans. Related Topics Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction Marine Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), commonly called the high seas, are those areas of ocean for which no one nation has sole responsibility for management. In all, these make up 40 percent of the surface of our planet, comprising 64 percent of the surface of the oceans and nearly 95 percent of its volume. Learn more Fisheries The global ocean is central to the livelihoods and food security of billions of people around the world, with an estimated 4.3 billion people reliant on fish for 15 percent of their animal protein intake. The ability of the ocean ecosystems to support long-term economic growth and essential protein is, however, threatened by human activities. Learn more Freshwater Sound management of freshwater basins and aquifers, particularly those shared across political boundaries, is largely about balancing the water needs across different sectors and nations. Shared freshwater resources comprise a special case for cooperation – water can be a driver for cooperation when countries embark on a path of trust and realizing the benefits of cooperative development and sharing benefits beyond the river with large potential spillover and global impacts. Learn more Large Marine Ecosystems The GEF’s role towards sustainable development of LMEs is second to none in the global arena. Our International Waters finance fills a crucial niche, catalyzing the development of transboundary Strategic Action Programs (SAPs) signed at the ministerial level. Learn more Marine The GEF works with partners to improve ocean governance with and across nations. Through such transboundary partnerships, we help countries develop regional institutional frameworks. These policy frameworks, in turn, enable countries to implement ecosystem-based approaches to manage fisheries and other marine and coastal resources. Learn more Shipping The GEF provides financial support to help implement regulatory instruments that address invasive alien species and ship-related accidents. Our contributions have helped reduce the frequency and harmful impact of invasive species, improve management of ports and related facilities, reduce ship waste, prevent oil spills and support contingency planning for important navigation routes in places like the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and especially Southeast Asia. Learn more What We Do Results Looking Ahead What We Do The GEFs International Water Focal area has a unique mandate: support transboundary cooperation in shared marine and freshwater ecosystems. The GEF has proven successful in building trust between states that often find themselves locked in complex and long-lasting marine resource and/or freshwater-use conflicts and achieving long-term benefits. Setting effective policy goals, coupled with investments, requires working at all scales, with a range of stakeholders, in the public and private sectors and across the watershed from source-to-sea and beyond. GEF investment in International Waters has three key objectives: Strengthening National Blue Economy Opportunities The Blue Economy concept identifies the oceans as areas for potential sustainable development of existing and new sectors, including tourism, extractive industries, renewable energy production, fisheries and aquaculture, coastal development and marine transport. The GEF helps countries identify sustainable public and private national investments in the Blue Economy, through funding of collective management of coastal and marine systems and implementation of the full range of integrated ocean policies, legal and institutional reforms. Improving Management in the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction The complex ecosystems in the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction — commonly called the high seas, those areas of ocean for which no one nation has sole responsibility for management — making the sustainable management of fisheries resources and biodiversity conservation especially challenging. Urgent action is needed to improve conservation and sustainable use of the open oceans that covers 40% of the planet, and are increasingly threatened by over-fishing of iconic pelagic migratory species, maritime navigation, ocean energy facilities, bottom trawling on seamounts, pollution, and extraction of minerals and hydrocarbons. Building on GEFs past experience in successfully supporting an applied ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management of deep sea fisheries, including seamounts, as well as regional tuna fisheries management organizations in the high seas. Enhancing Water Security in Freshwater Ecosystems Transboundary river basins cover about 50% of the earth’s land surface and are home to about 40% of the world’s population. More than 1 billion people live in river basins where human water use has surpassed sustainable limits. Cooperation on water, therefore, is vital to most international basins to support the need for water, food, energy, and ecosystems security and increase resilience for each nation. Shared groundwater resources are especially hard to manage due to the limited knowledge of the resource and its ‘invisibility.’ With mounting pressures on water resources and increasing pressures from climate variability and change managing surface and groundwater is the only sustainable path. GEF support in freshwater basins will therefore focus on three areas of strategic action: advance information exchange and early warning; enhance regional and national cooperation on shared freshwater surface and groundwater basins; and invest in water, food, energy and environmental security. Results The GEF is the largest funding mechanism for multi-country collaboration on water and oceans with 156 GEF recipient countries and 24 non-recipient countries working together to manage their transboundary water resources. Countries participating in GEF International Waters (IW) projects have negotiated and agreed on numerous regional cooperation frameworks, treaties, or protocols, ranging from cooperation on shared freshwater resources to agreements on marine resources. The GEF IW investments facilitate integrated cross-sectoral approaches that engage the private sector, non-governmental organizations and multilateral institutions. They are designed to work at multiple scales — from village chiefs to cabinet ministers — and across the entire watershed from ridge to reef. In doing so, these projects take innovative approaches that show how regionally agreed frameworks may produce global environmental benefits. At the same time, they incorporate the market value of marine resources into national economies, resulting in sustainable economic benefits, the creation and application of new technologies, or a shared aquifer or river, among other benefits. These integrated projects demonstrate the transformative social and economic impact that sustainable management of transboundary fresh and marine water resources can have on national economies. Looking Ahead Over the coming years countries will need to identify sustainable public and private national investments in ocean ecosystems. The GEF will support this process through funding of collective management of coastal and marine systems and implementation of integrated ocean policies, and legal and institutional reforms. The GEF has an opportunity to assist countries in effectively addressing a suite of stressors such as overfishing, land-based sources of pollution, and loss and damage of key coastal and marine ecosystems through a combination of national and regional investments targeted to strengthen national Blue Economy opportunities. It will now be up to coastal nations and the global community in general to reach these initial targets. However, the real challenge will be to formulate and implement new and more rigorous science-based targets that will help ensure that coastal and marine ecosystems will continue to support local livelihoods, economic growth, and ultimately sustain human health for generations to come.

220330,thegef_220330_03_007,https://www.thegef.org/topics/land-degradation,The Gef,"Main Issue Land is a vital resource to humankind, like air and water. Land degradation—the deterioration or loss of the productive capacity of the soils for present and future—is a global challenge that affects everyone through food insecurity, higher food prices, climate change, environmental hazards, and the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Land degradation is happening at an alarming pace, contributing to a dramatic decline in the productivity of croplands and rangelands worldwide. Land degradation is one of the world’s most pressing environmental problems and it will worsen without rapid remedial action. Globally, about 25 percent of the total land area has been degraded. When land is degraded, soil carbon and nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere, making land degradation one of the most important contributors to climate change. Scientists recently warned that 24 billion tons of fertile soil was being lost per year, largely due to unsustainable agriculture practices. If this trend continues, 95 percent of the Earth’s land areas could become degraded by 2050. Globally, 3.2 billion people are affected by land degradation, especially rural communities, smallholder farmers, and the very poor. The world population is projected to increase by about 35 percent to 9.7 billion in 2050, with rising demands for agricultural products including food, feed, fiber, and fuel. However, pressure on the global land resource is increasing due to other factors as well, such as agricultural production systems made less resilient by the loss of biodiversity, and natural factors such as climate variability and extreme weather events. Climate change exacerbates variations in yields and income from agriculture, threatening the resilience of agro-ecosystems and stability of food production systems. The problems are particularly severe in the driest parts the planet. Dryland landscapes cover approximately 40 percent of the world’s land area and support two billion people. The vast majority of people who depend on drylands live in developing countries, where women and children are most vulnerable to the impacts of land degradation and drought. Featured Content Document GEF Report to UNCCD COP15 March 16, 2022 Image Publication Land Degradation What We Do The GEF recognizes that all productive landscapes, from the drylands of Africa and Asia to the sub-tropical grasslands of South America, and temperate forests in Europe must be managed carefully and sustainably. Our investments to arrest and reverse desertification and deforestation cover a wide range sectors — from crop and livestock production to water resource management. The GEF is the financial mechanism for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and has a mandate to invest in global environmental benefits from production landscapes. The Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD recognizes Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) as a concept that can help communities, businesses, and governments reconcile the need to intensify food production without degrading land resources. Essentially, LDN is about managing land more sustainably to reduce degradation, while increasing rates of land restoration. The two ends converge to give a zero-net rate of land degradation. Results Since 2006, when land degradation became a focal area, the GEF has invested more than $1.069 billion in resources for at least 190 projects and programs that encourage use of sustainable land management practices (SLM) to support national and regional development priorities. 143 million hectares are now under SLM, benefitting more than 80 million smallholders. Our investments have greatly enhanced the potential for restoring degraded land. And our work in land degradation supports other focal areas such as Biodiversity and Climate Change by generating multiple benefits. In Burkina Faso, several multilateral partners financed the Sustainable Rural Development Program implemented by IFAD in the North Central Plateau. The GEF support helped to mainstream SLM into village development plans, develop conflict resolution systems, including specific financing mechanisms, and training. In terms of outcomes, the land related conflicts significantly decreased, 109 cases of access to land, services, and infrastructures were solved, and 26,000 producers were given sustainable access to land for cultivation and market gardens, 67% of beneficiaries being women. The project also successfully supported the restoration of 64,000 hectares of lands using indigenous soil and water conservation techniques locally called zaï and demi-lunes (respectively circular pits and half-moon ridges). Looking Ahead The GEF is well-placed to help countries implement convention decisions and facilitate coordinated investments in sustainable land management practices, including LDN. GEF investment will seek to address the drivers of land degradation, robust assessment of experience and existing knowledge, and knowledge and experience. The GEF strategy has two primary objectives: Support on the ground implementation of sustainable land management The three GEF Impact Programs form a major component of the GEF delivery towards combating land degradation and deforestation. The Food Systems, Land Use, and Restoration (FOLUR) Impact Program provides the opportunity for an integrated approach to implementing sustainable land management to increase the prospects for food security for smallholders and communities that are dependent on farming for their livelihoods. The Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Impact Program seeks to avoid further degradation, desertification, and deforestation of land and ecosystems in drylands through the sustainable management of production landscapes. The Sustainable Cities Impact Program will create opportunity for countries to integrate voluntary LDN targets into urban planning. Creating an enabling environment to support voluntary LDN target implementation A conducive enabling framework and overarching political support through the Convention is essential for LDN investments. GEF, for example, is working to embed the LDN concept into existing planning frameworks and participatory land-use planning, and is promoting policy work at national levels leading to the resolution of land tenure issues that are obstacles to LDN objectives. GEF will also make targeted investments to sustain and rebuild productive areas, mitigate the effects of drought, increase resilience, and prevent conflict and migration.",land-degradation
220330,thegef_220330_03_008,https://www.thegef.org/topics/amazon,The Gef,"Main Issue The Amazon accounts for more than 40% of Earth’s remaining rainforest and is home to at least 10% of the world’s known species. Critical to the rainforest’s health and rich biodiversity, the Amazon river flows for more than 6,600 km and contributes more than 15% of the world’s total river discharge into the oceans. The river and its more than 1,100 tributaries also contain the largest number of freshwater fish species in the world. The Amazon basin is one of the largest and mostly undisturbed forest ecosystems that still has the potential to be conserved and managed sustainably. Equally important, the Amazon plays a critical regional and global role in climate regulation. Amazon forests help regulate temperature and humidity and are linked to regional climate patterns through hydrological cycles that depend on the forests. The Amazon contains 90-140 billion metric tons of carbon, the release of even a portion of which could accelerate global warming significantly. Still, land conversion and deforestation in the Amazon release up to 0.5 billion metric tons of carbon per year, not including emissions from forest fires. The Amazon includes 610 protected areas, as well as 2,344 indigenous territories that cover 45 percent of the basin. The area is predominantly covered by dense moist tropical forest, while 14 percent of the Amazon is wetlands. Less extensive areas include savannas, floodplain forests, grasslands, swamps, bamboos and palm forests. About 33 million people live in the Amazon watershed, deriving their livelihoods from rivers and tributaries, including fisheries. The major threats to the Amazon biome include transportation infrastructure (roads), extractive industries (mining, oil, and gas), water infrastructure (dams, extraction, usage, waterways), and agricultural expansion driven primarily by commodity production, all of which, in direct and indirect ways, contribute to deforestation. What We Do The GEF established the Amazon Sustainable Landscapes Program in GEF-6, with participation of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru that together span 75% of the Amazon basin. The program builds on over a decade of work in the Amazon to strengthen biodiversity conservation, reduce deforestation, and improve community livelihoods. The GEF’s work in the Amazon focuses on improving the management and financial sustainability of protected areas; strengthening sustainable forest management; reducing carbon emissions from deforestation; and incorporating biodiversity management principles (both conservation and sustainable use) into selected sectors that are drivers of deforestation (i.e., agriculture, extractive industries, and infrastructure) through policies, sectoral agreements, and/or instruments that engage private sector actors. These interventions together aim to improve the overall connectivity of the Amazon ecosystem, thereby furthering the integrity of the local, regional, and global ecosystem services. Results In October 2015, the GEF announced a five-year commitment of $113 million for the Amazon Sustainable Landscapes Program (ASL-1). We expect our investment will leverage another $682 million in additional financing. Since the inception of ASL-1, the GEF has supported the creation of 44 new protected areas in the Amazon region, covering 24 million hectares. The GEF’s efforts protect a significant percentage of the Amazon’s biodiversity, including 56 species that are threatened with extinction. Looking Ahead Managing the Amazon for environmental, economic, and climate benefits requires working across all sorts of boundaries: across countries and between jurisdictions in country; from local communities and indigenous peoples to national ministries and international treaty organizations; and among different ministries. Based on this assumption, the Amazon Sustainable Landscapes Program was the first significant regional investment by GEF to manage terrestrial ecosystems in the Amazon biome that included the participation of multiple countries. The effort has been expanded in GEF-7 with the approval of the Amazon Sustainable Landscapes Program (ASL-2) in June 2019. ASL-2 will seek to build upon the ongoing efforts of ASL-1, expanding the geographic scope, improving protected area systems including for wetlands/freshwater ecosystems, implementing integrated forest landscape approaches, and helping reinforce and improve coordination of actions on the ground, all the while fostering synergistic efforts within and between the participating countries. The ASL-2 Program will greatly expand in scale as it will now include Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname, which together cover approximately 92% of the basin. The program will invest in several instruments to develop a forest- and freshwater-based economy and consequently reduce deforestation in areas where the conservation of Amazonian ecosystems is of paramount importance for the health of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and associated ecosystem services, including climate change regulation. The program takes a multi-scale and multi-stakeholder integrated approach to protecting the Amazon ecosystem. The regional approach reflects commitment by countries and partner agencies to coordinate actions and priorities that cover a significant portion of the entire ecosystem, with the aim of creating connectivity of the forest across borders, enhancing ecosystem integrity, and achieving biome-wide reductions in deforestation. The coordinated approach includes expert knowledge sharing between the countries, which will serve as building blocks for deepening transboundary collaboration in addressing shared management challenges that are regional in nature, such as the management of freshwater ecosystems, infrastructure development for transport and energy development, and gold mining, among others. The ASL-1 Program will deliver multiple global environmental benefits, such as strengthening management effectiveness of more than 66 million hectares of protected lands; facilitating the creation of 4.3 million hectares of new protected areas; promoting sustainable productive practices in approximately 11 million hectares; restoring 35,000 hectares of forests; and, supporting actions to help mitigate 164 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MTCO2e) of emissions. The ASL-2 Program will deliver additional global environmental benefits, including strengthening management effectiveness of an additional 32 million hectares of protected lands, promoting sustainable productive practices in 16 million hectares of landscapes, restoring 18,000 hectares of land; and, supporting actions to help mitigate 29.8 MTCO2e of emissions.",amazon
220330,thegef_220330_03_009,https://www.thegef.org/topics/commodities,The Gef,"Main Issue What We Do Results Looking Ahead Main Issue More than 1.5 billion people depend directly on forests for their livelihoods, but about 7.6 million ha of tropical forest are lost every year — an area roughly the size of the Czech Republic. The loss of forests, and the accompanying loss of biodiversity, puts us in a downward spiral: apart from threatening the security and livelihoods of local communities, it reduces our access to clean water, decreases soil productivity and accounts for 12 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Soy, beef, and palm oil are used in a wide range of foods and goods that are consumed by billions of people around the world. They yield about US$92 billion a year to producers, many of whom are small-scale rural farmers. These commodities are also responsible for about 80 percent of tropical deforestation. Managed sustainably, soy, beef, and palm oil have the potential to become engines for rural development, addressing many of the global sustainable development goals for ending poverty and protecting the planet. Transforming these three key commodity supply chains also has the potential to significantly reduce tropical deforestation and stem climate change. Anticipated global economic growth and changing diets will strengthen the demand for agricultural commodities and place additional pressure on forests. As demand for agricultural commodities grows, we need to develop forward-thinking business models to manage sustainable commodity production that also maintains forests and important ecosystem services. What We Do The GEF launched the Good Growth Partnership (GGP) in 2017. Instead of treating production, demand, and investment interventions as separate tracks, the Partnership looks at where the layers of the supply chain integrate and overlap to enhance financial incentives and demand for sustainably produced agricultural commodities. With the demand for soy, beef and palm oil expected to double by 2030, the Good Growth Partnership works across production, financing, and demand to convene a wide range of stakeholders and initiatives to create lasting, transformative change throughout these key global commodity supply chains. This ambitious effort aims to balance the needs of a growing global population with social and environmental responsibilities. The program offers a wide range of support along and across entire commodity value chains. It invests at supply chain points that can address specific barriers. And it also links successful, but isolated initiatives, so they can be replicated throughout the sector. A number of initiatives in major producer countries promote sustainable production of commodities. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, Tropical Forest Alliance, and Consumer Goods Forum, for example, attempt to influence supply chain actors. They work toward diverting the frontier for commodities away from primary forests and areas of high conservation value. Through its program, the GEF wants to link these efforts with the work of governments and others along the entire global supply chain for soy, beef and oil palm. We also aim to strengthen engagement with a wide range of stakeholders — from smallholder farmers to global corporations. The Partnership has taken its integrated approach to Brazil, Paraguay, Liberia, and Indonesia. To date, we have contributed to the establishment of 13 sub-national, and national, government-led multi-stakeholder platforms, which are committed to legalizing and implementing long-term action plans for the production of sustainable palm oil, beef and soy. These plans are not UNDPs or the GEFs, but are owned and driven by the countries and their stakeholders. Results Identified 1.35 million hectares of high conservation value forest in North Sumatra, strengthened regulations to protect areas set-aside within plantation concessions, including review of EIAs, zoning regulations, and spatial plans. Approximatley 40,000 smallholder farmers will benefit from legal revisions to require enhanced support from the private sector Reviewed 220,000 hectares of Sime Darby Plantation Liberia’s concession area, one of the largest slated for development in Liberia. The Partnership also helped develop a 10-point plan to protect the Zodua Community Forest through regional dialogue and mediation. Helped 10 West and Central African countries, participating in the TFA 2020 Africa Palm Oil Initiative (APOI), make measurable progress toward achieving the Marrakesh Declaration for the Sustainable Development of the Palm Oil Sector in Africa. Launched the Asia Learning & Exchange Program, which provides grants for innovative research and knowledge exchange between Asian governments and companies which have a strong demand influence on palm oil, beef and soy markets Looking Ahead In GEF-7, the Food Systems, Land Use, and Restoration Impact Program will deepen engagement on beef, palm oil, and soy supply chains, and broaden its focus to include cocoa and coffee. Maintaining natural habitat is a critical aspect of the long-term pathway toward more sustainable food systems and land use, especially in the tropical forest regions. The GEF will support efforts to engage global and national supply chain actors — including smallholders and other producers, buyers, traders, retailers, and financing institutions — to further stimulate both supply and demand for deforestation-free agricultural commodities. The ultimate goal is to make deforestation-free a viable and mainstream business model. The GEF will also support efforts to strengthen existing weaknesses in the supply-chain approach, specifically the on-the-ground operationalization of deforestation-free commitments made by corporations over the past five years. This will be done while simultaneously assisting governments that have included addressing deforestation as a key national policy priority in progressing toward this goal. Despite sharing similar objectives, corporations and governments have, to a large degree, acted in isolation regarding approaches to addressing tropical deforestation. One critical step in converting these aspirations into action is, therefore, to work with government and major actors from across the supply chain on multi-stakeholder platforms like the Good Growth Partnership that achieve deeper collaboration, coordination, and understanding on advancing deforestation-free commodity implementation. Promising jurisdictional approaches, where comprehensive planning on a sub-national level aligns incentives between actors and generates multiple benefits for companies, governments, and local communities, may be targeted for platform development so that key actors from jurisdictions can exchange experiences, share successes, and inspire replication across countries and commodities.",commodities
220330,thegef_220330_03_010,https://www.thegef.org/topics/fisheries,The Gef,"Main Issue What We Do Results Looking Ahead Main Issue The global ocean is central to the livelihoods and food security of billions of people around the world, with an estimated 4.3 billion people reliant on fish for 15 percent of their animal protein intake. The ability of the ocean ecosystems to support long-term economic growth and essential protein is, however, threatened by human activities. These threats are exacerbated by fragmented and uncoordinated management decisions that at times are not informed by sound science. The $70 billion annual trade in international fisheries products is coming under increasing pressure as fishing systematically removes the larger species from our oceans. Making matters worse, pollution and other human activities on the coasts are removing key spawning and nursery habitats. The serious depletion of coastal and marine fish stocks is now threatening our biodiversity and the well-being of our coastal communities. Fisheries are a central component of the Blue Economy — a vision of a vibrant ocean and coastal areas that also fosters economic growth and sustainable livelihoods. A number of ocean and coastal nations around the world, most critically Small Island Developing States, but also including the European Union and larger coastal nations, are actively developing and promoting a Blue Economic growth agenda. What We Do The GEF promotes sustainable fishing practices and wider ecosystem stewardship on a regional level as well as through national investments that tie to regional commitments. Our investments support the move from exploited fisheries to more sustainable practices. At the same time, we improve management of national and shared seascapes to support the billions of people who depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. The majority of GEF investments supporting fisheries management have been through the large marine ecosystem (LME) portfolio. The Global 66 LMEs support over 85 percent of global fish catch; investment in these LMEs is thus essential to address unsustainable fishing. In most of these projects, efforts are underway to ensure fishing efforts are at sustainable levels through approaches to gear, catch levels and/or closures. The GEF also has invested in improved management of high seas fisheries, particularly tuna, through the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction program. Within the Western and Central Pacific region, for example, 15 of 22 Pacific islands and territories participated in a GEF ocean management project. The project serves as a showcase for empowering small islands to engage on an even footing with larger and more politically influential countries. Results In recognition of the vital role fisheries play in eliminating hunger, promoting health, and reducing poverty, the GEF supports sustainable fishing practices and wider ecosystem stewardship both on national and regional levels. The GEF has promoted improved management of shared fishery resources, for example in West Africa, the Humboldt Current, Bay of Bengal, the Coral Triangle as well as in the open sea, such as the Western Central Pacific. To date, the GEF through its International Waters focal area, has invested $160 million in coastal and marine fisheries, leveraging roughly $1 billion in funding from other partners. Traditional methods of catching shrimp are inefficient, as fishers often end up with young fish, turtles and other by-catch. Over 60 percent of shrimp is discarded, making it among the most environmentally damaging fisheries in the world. The GEF is working to address bycatch in the Latin America and Caribbean region in shrimp and bottom trawl fisheries. Almost all participating countries have tested the use of trawl nets, which make it easier and faster for fishers to process the shrimp. In Mexico, for example, more than 140 vessels using the new methods and reported both increased quantity and quality of shrimps. Looking Ahead GEF support through the International Waters Focal Area will promote sustainable fishing practices and strengthen ecosystem governance both at national and regional levels to maintain productivity while sustaining biodiversity within fisheries. GEF-7 will build on, strengthen, and expand existing partnerships and address national and shared fisheries by supporting existing governance goals and targets. The International Waters strategy will help reduce anthropogenic pressures – e.g. pollution, overfishing and destructive fishing, and unregulated coastal development – and contribute to the integrity and resilience of vulnerable coastal and marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, and associated ecosystems. The GEF-7 International Waters focal area strategy will also support countries as they identify sustainable public and private national investments under the rubric of the Blue Economy, including effort to improve management of vital fisheries. GEF will help fund collective management of coastal and marine systems and implementation of the full range of integrated ocean policies, and legal and institutional reforms. This will be done in tandem with catalyzing regional processes, such as the transboundary diagnostic analysis/strategic action program in order to advance cooperation in large marine ecosystems. Approximately 100 GEF-eligible nations have used this process to reach agreements to improve Ocean management. GEF has an opportunity to assist countries in effectively addressing a suite of stressors such as overfishing, land-based sources of pollution, and loss and damage of key coastal and marine ecosystems through a combination of national and regional investments targeted to strengthen national Blue Economy opportunities. Given the numerous initiatives around oceans in recent years that have emerged in the international community circles, there is a clear need to establish an overarching and integrated framework required to mobilize action, and support institutions in a cross-sectoral transition toward achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.",fisheries
220330,thegef_220330_03_011,https://www.thegef.org/topics/food-security,The Gef,"Main Issue What We Do Results Looking Ahead Main Issue People are already consuming natural resources at a rate faster than the planet can replenish them. Yet the world’s population is expected to grow from 7 billion to 9 billion by 2050. Thus, the demand for energy, transport, buildings, and food will only increase in the years ahead. Agriculture will need to meet the growing demand for food — projected to increase by 70 percent by mid-century. The global food system’s impact on biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem services is overwhelming. With 40 percent of the planet’s landmass (excluding deserts, permanent ice, and lakes) being used to grow food, the potential for environmental degradation will only increase as agriculture continues to expand. At the same time, nearly 2 billion hectares of cropland, grazing land, forests, and woodlands are degraded. This has negative impacts on ecosystem services, including the provision of freshwater, food, fuel and fiber, clean air and water, climate regulation, and habitat. The global challenge is to find sustainable ways to feed a growing population. The world needs a more sustainable food system, one that embeds sustainability from farm to fork, generates agricultural commodities without deforestation and habitat conversion, and restores soils and degraded areas back into natural ecosystems or into productivity. What We Do How the world’s food systems and land use evolve will have major implications for the health of the planet. During the sixth GEF replenishment cycle (also known as GEF-6), the GEF joined forces with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), to launch the Integrated Approach Program on Food Security (IAP-FS), also known as the Resilient Food Systems (RFS) program. The five-year program (2017-2022) is committed to fostering sustainability and resilience for food security in Sub-Saharan Africa, targeting four geographies in the region that are seriously affected by environmental degradation and loss of ecosystem services, resulting in persistently low crop and livestock productivity. The Resilient Food Systems program is conducting activities across 12 African countries - Burkina Faso, Burundi, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda - contributing to a paradigm shift in the continent’s agriculture: one which emphasizes the importance of natural capital and ecosystem services to enhance agricultural productivity. Results The Resilient Food Systems program fosters sustainability and resilience by creating or strengthening institutional frameworks, scaling up integrated approaches, and monitoring and assessment of global environmental benefits. Two million households are expected to benefit from the program’s interventions across 12 Sub-Saharan African countries. The program contributes to maintaining globally significant biodiversity and the ecosystem goods and services, bringing 1.1 million hectares of landscapes under improved production practices, and an additional 2.1 million hectares under sustainable land management. It also supports a transformational shift towards a low emission and resilient development path, mitigating 59 million metric tons of carbon. Looking Ahead Given the fact that increasing demand for food is one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss, land degradation, and depletion of water resources, during GEF-7, the GEF’s Food Systems, Land Use, and Restoration Impact Program (FOLUR) will support efforts to ensure that productive lands are embedded within landscapes that provide ecosystem services as well as protect the natural ecosystems and soil on which they depend. The FOLUR Impact Program will support efforts to design systems that protect our planet’s biophysical processes and resources, absorb greenhouse gas emissions, provide nutritious and affordable food for the growing number of people worldwide, and strengthen the resilience and prosperity of rural populations. Achieving this transition will require a holistic, system-wide approach integrating both horizontal (land and natural resources) and vertical (food value and supply chain) dimensions. In order to accommodate differences between countries with respect to opportunities for leveraging GEF financing, the Impact Program focuses on three interrelated priorities: promoting sustainable food systems to tackle negative externalities in entire value chains; promoting deforestation-free agricultural commodity supply chains; and promoting large-scale restoration of degraded landscapes for sustainable production and ecosystem services. The FOLUR Impact Program seeks to transform food and land use systems and help countries reconcile competing social, economic, and environmental interests by moving away from unsustainable sectoral approaches. GEF support will help countries meet the growing demand for increased crop and livestock production while eliminating the risk of further expansion of farmland into natural high-biodiversity habitats and forests, erosion of genetic diversity, overexploitation of land and water resources, overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and inefficient practices that lead to greenhouse gas emissions.",food-security
220330,thegef_220330_03_012,https://www.thegef.org/topics/sustainable-cities,The Gef,"Overview Objective & Structure Green Recovery Overview The world is urbanizing more rapidly than ever before, and cities in developing countries are growing at an even higher pace. While cities contribute to global economic growth, they are also drivers of environmental degradation. Cities consume 80% of global energy, are responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions, generate huge amounts of waste and pollution, and are rapidly encroaching into natural habitats. Urban sprawl is leading to poor living conditions, making cities highly vulnerable to climate change, and threatening the biodiversity surrounding cities. By 2050 as much as 70% of the global population is predicted to live in cities, which makes it even more important to shift towards compact, low-carbon, resilient, and inclusive cities. Recognizing that cities are key to achieving global environmental and sustainability goals, the GEF launched the Sustainable Cities Integrated Approach Pilot in 2016 as part of the GEF-6 cycle (2014-2018). The program is now under implementation, supporting 28 cities in 11 countries with integrated urban sustainability solutions, and the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPSC) helps facilitating city-to-city exchange and knowledge creation. Building on the experience and lessons learnt from this pilot, the Sustainable Cities Impact Program in the GEF-7 cycle (2018-2022) advances the integrated approach of urban planning and implementation under its brand name UrbanShift. The program is supporting 23 cities in 9 countries, and focuses on integrated urban planning, low-carbon infrastructure, sustainable waste management and nature-based solutions for urban sustainability. UrbanShift brings together global, national, and local stakeholders, and engages with city-based organizations and the private sector to work towards common sustainability visions. The GEF’s Sustainable Cities program adopts an integrated and systems-based approach for urban sustainability. It targets systemic barriers to advance sustainability solutions which include institutional, political, and financial constraints, uncoordinated urban policies, siloed land use planning, lack of knowledge and technical capacity, and limited engagement of stakeholders in decision-making. The Sustainable Cities program takes a holistic approach of strengthening urban governance and planning, supporting investments in innovative and impactful sustainability solutions, catalyze innovative financing and business models, and facilitate global collaboration and partnerships to shift from ‘business as usual’ path towards urban transformation. In total, the GEF’s Sustainable Cities program work with 51 cities across 17 countries, through $310 million in GEF grants, leveraging nearly $4 billion in co-financing. The program aims to reduce more than 250 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable management of nearly 1 million hectares in addition to climate resilience benefits and socio-economic benefits of vulnerable communities. The map below shows the cities participating in the GEF-6 and GEF-7 cycles of the program. UrbanShift Global Platform for Sustainable Cities 51 cities 17 countries $310 million GEF grant financing $4 billion co-financing leveraged Objective & Structure The objective of the Sustainable Cities program is to support cities in developing innovative sustainability solutions and strengthening institutional capacity to move towards a net zero carbon, nature positive, inclusive and resilient urban future. The program aims to deliver impactful development outcomes at large scale and with multiple global environmental benefits, through two interlinked components: Country and city-level interventions with on-the-ground projects in participating cities, working together with city officials, urban actors and national governments to create innovative models for implementation of integrated sustainability solutions and investments in selected cities and countries. A global platform and coordination project to connect participating cities with global expertise and cutting-edge research for integrated urban planning, city-to-city knowledge exchange, learning and sharing of best practices. As the country and city-level investments lead to both local and global environmental benefits, the global platform will enhance the potential for amplifying the benefits across many more cities in recipient countries. The Sustainable Cities Integrated Approach Pilot in GEF-6 is led by the World Bank in partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), UN Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the World Resources Institute (WRI), C40 Cities, and ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability. In GEF-7, the Sustainable Cities Impact Program under its brand name UrbanShift is led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the implementing partners include WRI, C40 Cities, ICLEI, UNDP, the World Bank, and ADB. Green Recovery To support its response to COVID-19, the GEF created the COVID-19 Response Task Force which has published a White Paper on a GEF COVID-19 Response Strategy to help identify the future risks linked to emerging infectious diseases and human welfare linked to environmental degradation. The paper calls specifically on cities to strengthen and extend their networks and focus on sectors that can support ecological transformation and job creation, such as decentralized urban energy, local food systems, and retrofitting buildings. Cities are at the frontline of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to economic, social and health crises on top of the environmental crisis. During these challenging times, the GEF’s Sustainable Cities program is working with cities to deliver multiple environmental benefits while supporting economic growth and livability. The program contributes directly to areas linked to green recovery, such as protecting natural areas around cities from urban sprawl, integrating resilience, creating new green jobs and livelihood opportunities in cities, and mobilizing private sector investments and innovation. The integration approach of the Sustainable Cities program is enabling cities to take a green recovery path through integrated planning, improved governance and global collaboration, supporting cities and countries to build back better.

This isn’t just one of our values; it’s our mission—one hand extended out to another to meet people where they are and treat others as equals.” -- USAID Administrator Samantha Power Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategy - Executive Summary (pdf - 274k) USAID is committed to a diverse, equitable, inclusive workplace where everyone has an opportunity to thrive. The Agency’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Strategy commits USAID to improving and enhancing diversity throughout the Agency, enhancing inclusion and equity for everyone in the workplace, and strengthening accountability for promoting and sustaining a diverse workforce and an inclusive Agency culture. In order to achieve the first of these goals: enhancing diversity throughout the Agency, Agency leadership will proactively address internal systems that potentially inhibit inclusive diversity efforts and access throughout the USAID employee life cycle; will develop, implement, and enhance a range of policies, programs, practices, and systems to improve and increase diversity; and will develop and implement broad outreach strategies to attract talent from diverse sources. In order to achieve the second of these goals: enhancing inclusion and equity for everyone in the workplace, Agency leaders will champion and enable staff participation in initiatives that work toward the betterment of the Agency’s efforts in DEI and actively engage with these groups to operationalize their recommendations and efforts. Agency leadership will establish and enhance training and capacity-building opportunities for all staff, including managers and supervisors, on diversity fundamentals, bias, and principles of inclusion -- all of which contribute to a respectful, safe, and inclusive work environment that enhances retention. The third goal of the strategy is to achieve strengthened accountability for promoting and sustaining a diverse workforce and an inclusive Agency culture. To achieve this goal, the Agency will consistently apply DEI principles across program and management operations; all leaders at the Agency will be required to show evidence of their support for DEI at USAID; performance management efforts at the Agency will promote accountability to create and sustain a diverse and inclusive workplace at all staff levels; and, finally, Agency efforts to promote DEI will be informed by workforce data and principles of transparency. These goals, and the actions the Agency is committed to taking to ensure progress and change on DEI, have been established in this strategy following a rigorous process that included data collection, analysis, stakeholder interviews, focus groups, listening sessions, and consultations at all levels throughout the Agency. A range of stakeholders were involved in developing this strategy. The establishment of this strategy does not end this process, but, rather, ensures that the process will continue, that concrete actions will be taken, and that there will be accountability for the achievement of the goals. As Administrator Power remarked, “Too often, the burden of making a workplace more equitable, more respectful, more welcoming and inclusive, falls on under-represented and under-resourced and under-supported diverse staff.” This strategy ensures that everyone in the Agency shares the responsibility and opportunity for embracing our commitment to creating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace in USAID.

220330,usaid_220330_3_003,https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history,usaid,"JFK speaks to USAID directors and deputy directors on the White House lawn, June 8, 1962. Robert Knudsen Celebrating Sixty Years of Progress When the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was created, it brought together several existing foreign assistance organizations and programs. Until then, there had never been a single agency charged with foreign economic development, so with the passage of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (pdf) by Congress, U.S. foreign assistance activities underwent a major transformation. Leading this transformation was President John F. Kennedy. President Kennedy recognized the need to unite development into a single agency responsible for administering aid to foreign countries to promote social and economic development. On November 3, 1961, USAID was born and with it a spirit of progress and innovation. November 3, 2011 marked USAID's 50th Anniversary of providing U.S. foreign development assistance From the American People. Our workforce and USAID's culture continues to serve as a reflection of core American values--values that are rooted in a belief for doing the right thing. ""There is no escaping our obligations: our moral obligations as a wise leader and good neighbor in the interdependent community of free nations – our economic obligations as the wealthiest people in a world of largely poor people, as a nation no longer dependent upon the loans from abroad that once helped us develop our own economy – and our political obligations as the single largest counter to the adversaries of freedom."" – John F. Kennedy Early International Development Efforts The modern-day concept of international development assistance took shape after World War II ended in 1945. George C. Marshall, the Secretary of State from 1947 to 1949 provided significant financial and technical assistance to Europe after the war. Famously known as the Marshall Plan, this was a successful effort that allowed Europe to rebuild its infrastructure, strengthen its economy, and stabilize the region. International Aid Becomes Foreign Policy Building on the success of the Marshall Plan, President Harry S. Truman proposed an international development assistance program in 1949. The 1950 Point Four Program focused on two goals: Creating markets for the United States by reducing poverty and increasing production in developing countries Diminishing the threat of communism by helping countries prosper under capitalism From 1952 to 1961, programs supporting technical assistance and capital projects continued as the primary form of U.S. aid, and were a key component of U.S. foreign policy. During this time, government leaders established various precursor organizations to USAID, including the: Mutual Security Agency Foreign Operations Administration International Cooperation Administration International Aid in the 1960s: An Agency is Born In 1961, President Kennedy signed the Foreign Assistance Act into law and created USAID by executive order. Once USAID got to work, international development assistance opportunities grew tremendously. The time during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations became known as the “decade of development.” International Aid in the 1970s: A Shift to Basic Human Needs In the 1970s, the USAID began to shift its focus away from technical and capital assistance programs. Instead, U.S. development assistance stressed a “basic human needs” approach, which focused on: Food and nutrition Population planning Health Education Human resources development International Aid in the 1980s: A Turn to Free Markets In the 1980s, foreign assistance sought to stabilize currencies and financial systems. It also promoted market-based principles to restructure developing countries' policies and institutions. During this decade, USAID reaffirmed its commitment to broad-based economic growth, emphasizing employment and income opportunities through a revitalization of agriculture and expansion of domestic markets. In this decade, development activities were increasingly channeled through private voluntary organizations (PVOs), and aid shifted from individual projects to large programs. International Aid in the 1990s: Sustainability and Democracy In the 1990s, USAID’s top priority became sustainable development, or helping countries improve their own quality of life. During this decade, USAID tailored development assistance programs to a country's economic condition, which meant that: Developing countries received an integrated package of assistance Transitional countries received help in times of crisis Countries with limited USAID presence received support through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) USAID played a lead role in planning and implementing programs following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. USAID programs helped establish functioning democracies with open, market-oriented economic systems and responsive social safety nets. International Aid in the 2000s: War and Rebuilding The 2000s, brought more evolution for USAID and foreign assistance with government officials once again calling for reform of how the agency conducts business. With the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in full swing, USAID was called on to help those two countries rebuild government, infrastructure, civil society and basic services such as health care and education. The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations. It also began an aggressive campaign to reach out to new partner organizations – including the private sector and foundations – to extend the reach of foreign assistance. Today, USAID staff work in more than 100 countries around the world with the same overarching goals that President Kennedy outlined 50 years ago – furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while also extending a helping hand to people struggling to make a better life, recover from a disaster or striving to live in a free and democratic country. It is this caring that stands as a hallmark of the United States around the world. USAID Today Our objective is to support partners to become self-reliant and capable of leading their own development journeys. We make progress toward this by reducing the reach of conflict, preventing the spread of pandemic disease, and counteracting the drivers of violence, instability, transnational crime and other security threats. We promote American prosperity through investments that expand markets for U.S. exports; create a level playing field for U.S. businesses; and support more stable, resilient, and democratic societies. We stand with people when disaster strikes or crisis emerges as the world leader in humanitarian assistance. Last updated: November 12, 2021 Share This Page",USAID History

We'll support a broad programme of discovery research across a wide range of disciplines with the potential to make important and unanticipated discoveries about life, health and wellbeing – both to help us tackle these great challenges, and to inspire further improvements in human health. And we're developing programmes of work that draw on Wellcome's expertise across science, innovation and society to deliver ambitious goals: Mental health: Working with people who have lived experience of mental health issues to improve research, understanding and treatment of mental health. Infectious disease: Working with communities affected by escalating infectious diseases to bring those diseases under control and stop epidemics. Climate and health: Working with the communities most affected by climate change to explore the harmful effects of climate change on health, and to use research to develop new ways of protecting people’s health. We are working towards a world in which: Significant shifts in understanding lead to improved human health. No one is held back by mental health problems. Escalating infectious diseases are under control in the communities most affected. Climate change does not harm health in the communities it affects most. Diversity and inclusion, and research culture, are central to our strategy and will be embedded into the work we fund and do. Why we believe in this vision Science is essential to solving the world’s health challenges. That’s Wellcome's founding principle and it’s as true today as ever. It’s why we will always support bold research across a wide range of disciplines to discover more about life, health and wellbeing. But three global challenges today threaten to undermine our efforts to improve health for decades to come. The effects of mental health problems, escalating infectious diseases, and climate change limit life for people of all ages in all parts of the world, and can devastate communities for generations. These are the urgent health challenges of the 21st century and Wellcome is taking them on. That means significant commitments and actions sustained over many years. Discovery research – defined broadly, including physical and social sciences and the humanities – will underpin the best solutions to these challenges, though science alone is not enough. It needs support from many areas of research and innovation, and advocacy for approaches built on scientific evidence. And because the effects of these challenges will not be felt evenly across the world’s population, this must be done in partnership with the people whose health is most at risk. Wellcome's perspective on health and how to improve it spans science, innovation and society. We are connecting people across research and society to discover new knowledge, inspire new ideas, and create new solutions. We are campaigning for better science and better systems to ensure solutions work for those who most need them and have the right support to be implemented, whether that’s today or over the next 30 years. In all that Wellcome does, we want the broadest possible range of people to contribute to, and benefit from, science's potential to change the world.What's at stakeFewer than 1 in 5 people with common mental health problems like depression get proper treatment – science and medicine need to progress faster. Unless action is taken now, climate change will cause at least 250,000 more deaths a year between 2030 and 2050 – climate is a health issue that urgently needs research. Over 1 million people have already died from Covid-19 and more are living with its long-term effects – we need to get infectious diseases under control before they can become pandemics. Our funding The way we fund research is changing to fit our strategy. For discovery research, we've moved to a new, simplified set of funding schemes designed to encourage a broader range of applications. They are open to research in any discipline that has the potential to lead to significant shifts in the understanding of life, health and wellbeing. In our three new health challenge programmes, funding will be directed in different ways across each programme. Find out more about how our current schemes are changing and our new discovery research schemes. And sign up for our Research Update newsletter to stay informed on future funding opportunities.Wellcome Science Review Our strategy has been greatly informed by a review of the way Wellcome, as an independent foundation, supports science. Key findings Wellcome-funded science should enable science and innovation to tackle the greatest threats facing humanity, and it should do so through a broad programme of discovery research together with research directed at specific health challenges.
